 Of the five assignments I've read, yours needs the most amount of revision in my opinion. I'm not exactly sure how to approach your writing, as I kind of think the whole thing needs to be rewritten. The assignment was to decide on what the future of the book will be and give a 300 word explanation of it, followed by why you think that society is leaning in the direction of your chosen mode of literary media. To me, your assignment just seems to tell of how you've done some research on your family history.

I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information. It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to ˜disappear into their own world.

,"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"". I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination. The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer. I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text. Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go. But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story.

In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories. Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster.

,"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free.

 Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner. -- that needs to be than.
 
 Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves. --their needs to be they are or they're.
 
 
 
 ""Film will always be more powerful than text."" This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement. Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why. Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film. But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form. It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.
 
 
 
 Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book. So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is. I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.

 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that.

 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right?

 This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response. Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent. While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc. don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment.

,"The patch was very well done and simplified to the barebones of what was need, with some slight flare for aesthetics. It is apparent that this submission was created by someone with prior Max/MSP experience or has done a formidable amount of practice in such a small amount of time since class has begun. I did learn how I could have simplified my patch even further and how to add in a feature like the option to randomly choose an ASCII key code. Overall, this was A+ work for this assignment in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looked very colorful, and each part was explained nicely. There was even a little humor thrown into one explanation. Each part is split into three sections, and each part has its own color.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"One thing I thought was really cool was the addition of a volume control that would let you control how loud or quiet the sounds were overall. Each sound has its own meter, so you can see how each loud or soft each sound was. I was more involved as a user since I could pick my own key number from a generator and control pretty much everything. However, the random number generator wouldn't give out a number, so I would have to type my own number to get it to run the sounds. The 'yes' sound was pleasant and not overbearing, and the 'no' sound made me cringe a little just because of what it actually was, but it was amusing though.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technically, there was a lot going on ""under the hood"", but you couldn't see all the connections from the layout that was presented. Not a bad thing since it's much clearer that way. It's not until you unlock it could you poke around a little. I did learn how to use the volume controller since I thought that was nice touch to the whole thing. As mentioned earlier, the random number generator didn't work, so maybe double checking everything just to make sure everything works as it should. Other than that, it's a good patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Compared to what we initially created in class the aesthetic of this patch was definitely colorful and fun to look at. The overall feel was that it was engaging but the connections were hidden and obscured being able to know how this patch was made.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It took me a few minutes to work out what was actually going on because of how different it was from what I had seen before. After getting over my initial confusion I enjoyed the humorous dynamic of the step by step instructions and enjoyed playing with it. The sounds were somewhat uncreative but succinct in their functionality.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Having an added volume control was a nice component to the overall interface. The overall approach was creative and fun although somehow seemingly simplistic. The color was a surprise and it was exciting to be involved in choosing a 'yes' key. I definitely got some ideas of how to improve the aesthetic and interactive components of future projects.The random generator key did not seem to do anything and I would have liked to have access to a version where I could see how they 'wired' everything together.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Looked nice and neat. Very impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Visually, the patch was very pleasing. the good key sound and bad key sound had nice contrast.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Everything was hidden and even as I was dismantling the patch, I had no idea how anything was connected. As a novice user, I had nothing to gain from this patch from a coding perspective. It was just presented as an end user product.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I love the look of it and all the colors it's the only one I've seen like that.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The horn like sound kind of through me off. Headphone + volume up= not a good idea. But I like the other sound. 
 
 I like how everything is written out it makes it easier to use",,,,,,,,,,,
,"idk how they coded it but i was pleasantly surprised by it and i'd like to make my patches more ""clean"" looking as they did",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is organized. There's a clear visual logic (top to bottom), and added text comments on certain sections help in understanding each part.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The experience is marginally interesting, in a way similar to my own (after tweaking and playing with it several times). Nothing particularly interests me, though I do find that the ""failure"" sound is louder and more jarring than the ""success"" sound in a way that makes the latter feel rewarding.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technically, the creator did not depart from the in-class instructions at all, which means the patch works fine. It would have been cool to see innovation, with more sounds and/or more than two outcomes. Moreover, the fact that the speaker is turned off by default is a bit confusing.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very basic. Almost equivalent to the patch that David created in class to demonstrate how to execute this project. Not very aesthetically pleasing, however it is straight forward and easy to follow.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds were somewhat entertaining. The ""Bad Keys"" play a laser sound that was probably found within an online wav file library, and the ""Good Key"" was a similar swirling sound. Both sounds have a technological, galactic type of sound that seem as if they could be found in a space-themed computer game.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is essentially an exact replica of the patch we created together in class during our first Max demo. All that is different are the sounds. There wasn't anything particularly surprising or exciting about it. Since most of us are still pretty unfamiliar with Max, I understand there might not have been much else to include to differentiate between this patch and the one created in class. However, while playing around with my own project, I figured out how to edit colors, change fonts and font sizes, and a few other basic ways to change the overall aesthetic and make it a little more interesting. Perhaps Khanh could have done the same.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It looks very clean and easy to understand. Although it gave away that the ""k"" key is the good key!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Because of the old-school laser sound, it reminds me of playing an arcade game. The bad sound reminds me of when you die in Galaga, and the good sound reminds me of your ship getting abducted by the enemies in the game. It's fun to play, but I'm a little bummed that the key was given away in the patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technically speaking, the patch is very simple. It's laid out very basically so it's extremely easy to understand what things cause which reactions from the system. Pressing one of the keys causes a button to light up so the user can tell where the reaction is taking place in the patch. Also there is a sound meter that lets you visually see the sound. There isn't anything very exciting about it, however, I think the patch gets the job and its simplicity is appreciated.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is very clean and easy to read. It would be easy to copy parts of it if necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is very mysterious. The sounds remind me of an alien but it is hard to tell what sound is the good key and which one is the bad key.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, there was nothing new added to this patch or nothing I could learn from it. It was very straight forward. If you could do something better it would be to add another concept to the patch and also make the sounds more recognizable as ""good"" and ""bad"".",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It looks very approachable with every feature of the patch explained in short, but sweet notes",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It feels very entertaining to use and offers a simple, yet satisfying experience.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I was rather surprised that the creator explained every single part of the patch, made things very easy to understand. I learned now that for the next max patches to put notes by all feature so that new users understand them better. Nothing too bad to say, really.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is very detailed, and uses lots of comment boxes to explain what everything does.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like the sounds that were chosen, it's fun to play with. However, the patch shows the correct key which makes it easy to win.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I like how they used the print function to make WRONG pop up when the incorrect was used. That was a nice touch. The only thing that I wish was different is how they show the right key.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Not a lot as far as features go, but quite understandable.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It feels pretty goofy to use, but in a good way. Most notably due to the sound cues used.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Nothing too surprising outside of the humorous sound files. Although there's nothing bad to say about it either.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"looks clean. Simple one key ""yes"".",,,,,,,,,,,
,"a little goofy, but that is due to the audio effects.",,,,,,,,,,,
,it seemed more simplified than mine. But I used multiple keys and not mono sound.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The look is very condensed and minimalistic, the commands are close together and compact.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds are silly and made me laugh, I wasn't expecting them. I'm tempted to just sit and mash the keyboard to hear the sounds.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I do like how their patch is stripped and small, I know that in mine I definitely put too many operations that weren't needed. I wish they didn't put which was the correct key in the locked patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is easy to understand and looks similar to the example in class. After looking at this patch, I realized the importance of comments. I wish I added more comments in my own personal patch as this person did so another person could understand what to do on my patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The sounds are goofy and funny which make the patch exciting to do over and over again. The sounds are entertaining but the design seems very practical so there are two different feelings coming from the patch.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch seems very typical. It is similar to the tutorial that was explained in class. I did learn that I should use more comments in my own patch since the comments on this patch helped me understand what was going on. However, I added almost none to my match and I have a feeling people will be confused. I feel like they could have simplified the patch more or at least made it cleaner looking because it looks crammed and spread out.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It is simple just like the one reviewed in class, but it does not take away from the effectiveness of the program. I know what each of the components do and the buttons are additional visuals to the sound when the program is active.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is comical, comprising of bomb noises as each incorrect key is pressed and when the correct key is pressed, the hallelujah sound is like a mini praise for finding the correct one. However, I think the sounds are a little long for such rapid key pressing. I know as I was going through it I pressed it maybe once to hear the sound and then continued to press until I found the right key, not even waiting for the sound to finish. The correct key sound was extremely long as well and made me want to hit an incorrect key just to stop it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is identical to the example in class but I cannot really diss or suggest something much better considering I am fairly new to Max 6 and my patch is pretty much the same. Nothing out of the ordinary, didn't really learn new information. I would just suggest making shorter sound files, but that doesn't have much to do with the actual coding aspect.",,,,,,,,,,,
,the look was elegant. Simple sounds.,,,,,,,,,,,
,feels good. Like the use of the sound bar.,,,,,,,,,,,
,nope. very simple.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It's nothing but the essentials in this patch - no aesthetic additions but the bare minimum for the game to work. Everything looks neatly arranged.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds were entertaining certainly. For me the missing sound reminds me of playing the game battleship and the victory sound of hallelujah is classic. I thought that it was amusing. It feels functional, but not much more than that. I would categorize more on the goofy than beautiful end of the spectrum.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"They approached it by creating the bare minimum needed to finish the assignment. This tells me it is likely they are newer to Max/MSP or simply didn't have much time to create anything ""prettier.""",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is very basic, but it's simplicity makes it easy to understand.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"In general, this patch isn't completely user friendly. In order for the patch to work, the user has to load both of the sound files and also turn on the sound. A couple of comments listing the steps to make the patch work would help users who don't know what they're doing.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds were pretty funny, especially the good sound. Even though the patch is very simple, if it was lined up more according to the grid in the patcher window, it might make it look better aesthetically.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It has a logical flow, but the connectors are all curved, so it looks a little unprofessional or messy. There are a few comments, but they're not specific or unclear if the person is unfamiliar with the program.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It is very goofy and simple. The game over sound is from a game and made me smile. I liked the sound choice. I was disappointed that the ready sound did not work.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class. It has two sounds: gameover.wav and ready.wav. The gameover sound works fine, but the ready sounds does not work.
 
 
 
 They could have left in the comments what key number 31 is.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is fairly neat and clean, it is well organized. The patch ran well but I am not sure if there was something wrong with the download files or not, but I couldn't get the sound files to work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch was nicely done and the experience was fun. It took me a while to figure out what was the good key. As I stated before, it might be my computer but I couldn't get the sound files to work in the patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The user seemed to stick with the basic structure and outline of the assignment, which isn't necessarily bad because I did the same. However, the patch did function properly and was very neat.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch itself has an overall nice flow to it when it comes to how many different things she used. She did it short and simple and its easy to follow.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I could only make one sound to work and that is only because i clicked on the button itself, unfortunately i could not fine the key to activate it itself but the sound that it makes I think is pretty amusing.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"As said before it only plays the sound when you find the key, it seems as if they placed the output to the wrong port around the speaker area, if not it would have worked perfectly fine i feel.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch looks pretty clean and seems simple. It appears similar to the Max patch we made in class.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch detects key presses yet it seems impossible to get the keycode that the student set for a 'yes'. It feels fine though it feels annoying that I can't get the 'yes' to play. The sounds don't seem to work.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This student is checking for a keycode that I am not sure how to recreate, even after using google, which is surprising yet not quite exciting. Otherwise, it's similar to the patch made in class. The no sound doesnt play either, though it's possible to get a 'no' response from a key press. They could have made it possible for the user to get a 'yes' to play, which taught me that it can be really powerful if you have something that the user wants to do but cannot or does not know how.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It is simple just like the class example but it does not take away any elements to how it functions. It is just a little more expanded vertically.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think it would have been great if it worked all the way. When I finally hit the correct key, I heard the sound; however, there was a problem with every other key where there was no sound heard. I even pressed the open ready.wav and no sound came through so I had to hear how it sounded from the actual folder. The idea was great, making every other key seem like it was correct and the correct key the fail since it said game over.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The basic layout from the example in class but I cannot judge since that is how I did mine. In general, just making sure that the sound file is working properly since there was some trouble there.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well, I opened the patch but it unzipped as a AIFF and not a patch. Even after trying to launch it through MAX, nothing still worked.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Judging from the files in the user's folder, they seemed to have created a really awesome patch. I wish it would have loaded properly on my computer.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"As I said before, solely judging from the files in the user's zip folder, they seemed to have constructed a really interesting patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I was actually not able to view the max patch, the files contained all the music files and a max text file.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"As far as the included sound files, i could only tell that the ""so tired"" file was the bad key but for the rest I wasn't too sure. On the other hand they were pleasing to listen to.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I was not able to view the patch from what was downloaded.,,,,,,,,,,,
,There was no patcher file. There was music and a text file but no patcher.,,,,,,,,,,,
,No patcher to test,,,,,,,,,,,
,No patcher to test.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The visual logic of the patch is straightforward, and text comments direct user action very clearly.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Using the patch is a humorous experience. The creator took the extremely simple premise of the assignment and made a clever single-serving application.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"One significant technical problem is that the file was saved as .maxpat.txt, meaning it works only after the .txt extension is removed. It would have been much better if the file included was a max patch instead of a max patch interpreted as raw text. The use of several different outcomes from one piece of input data is a surprising technical innovation from which I feel I could learn something. The approach is very technically creative.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The overall feel for this patch is a short and simple layout that is easy to follow.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The sound files fit their descriptions well because there is a game over quote for not hitting the right key and a victory quote for when you finally find the correct key.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch worked perfectly fine with no problems at all, it took me a while to find the right key but i actually found it eventually so it was a success.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The design was very similar/identical to what the instructor designed in class. No alterations were performed to make the construction simpler. The construction resembled that of a christmas tree.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The setup was simple and easy to use. The sounds were entertaining to listen to (game over sound and fan uproar brought imagery to the listener).,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Due to the lack of change in the structure of the assignment, it seems that the only component that was creatively thought out were the audio files. Nothing surprising or exciting came from the design aspect of the project, but as previously stated the audio was entertaining to listen to.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch seems to look good, however when I tried to use the keys no sounds played back for me...",,,,,,,,,,,
,The sounds will not play back properly for me..,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The approach seems pretty simple, and straight forward, however it appears that somewhere within the program something was misplaced or forgotten.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.,,,,,,,,,,,
,My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy. It doesn't really have much of an experience since it tells you the correct key.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds to make it better.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Nice straight forward patch. I like that there was a comment telling me what the good key was. Having the buttons was nice because I could visually see there was a hit. I noticed there were two speakers so the sound would overlap.,,,,,,,,,,,
,When I tried to use the patch I had to manually press the open object and insert the name of the wave files. The good key was a ding but the bad key was a very obnoxiousHa Ha! It did not make me want to play with it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch did not work as it sat. I had to load the wav files to the open object. The patch could have been simpler if the sfplay~ name, 1 format had been used. There were extraneous parts that were unnecessary.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It looks pretty cool. looks like the person really tried to make it look original. I liked it a lot for that reason. I really like the images that I think this person made that surround the ezdac and the one on top with the keyboard. Those make it look really cool.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The experience was very cool. I liked how he also put videos for when you got it wrong and when you got it right. I also really liked the sound effects. Overall, I think it was really fun to use.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think that comments explaining how it works would have been nice. I think it was done very nicely and organized though. I did learn how to connect a video, so that was a good learning experience. It was Overall a great patch though.",,,,,,,,,,,

,"Conceptually this piece is very strong and it is designed in a way to really engage the user to feel comfortable interacting with the patch. I did enjoy the sounds, it sounds like these were keys to a guitar and feels very authentic because it is not recognizable. I think the user experience is straight forward and through the tune of the guitar a indication of emotion is felt through the good/bad key.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job. I understand the allure of creating symmetry with the patch, which is probably why the meter was left out. However, I think they still could have incorporated this in an artistic way to compliment the rest of the piece. I feel this piece was visually and functionally very strong, therefore, I would challenge the creator to link music for the good/bad key that invokes more of an intense emotion.

,"It feel very basic when using the patch. There is no audio feedback, as in meters, when pressing a button; there is no feedback whatsoever when pressing the different buttons on the keyboard. The sounds, though, are pretty goofy so entertainment value is a high point.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The assignment was left as it was demonstrated in class...with even less than that. It does the job of relaying good and bad keys perfectly well, and the sounds are fun, but it is extremely basic otherwise.

,The patch looks different than the one done in class. It looks almost like a game. I liked the feel of it because it looks very simple without any complicated components or anything.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch felt very fun to use. It was almost like a game to try and find the right key. I liked how the design was simple and there were only two buttons.

,They approached the coding assignment differently than in class. The technical elements were the same as they were looking for one key but the design was executed a little differently.

,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, the only thing new that I saw was when it was locked everything was hidden. I would really like to learn how you did that.

,"Something that I thought that was interesting about the coding on this patch was hiding of almost all the elements, minus the button. I did not know that you can hide all of these elements and is definitely something that I learned while going over this patch. My only concern was that since most of the elements were hidden was that I could not easily click on the ezdac~ message in order to turn the sound on.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch had a very clean and professional look to it. This was because there were only necessary components in the patch, nothing extra. Also, the patch was aligned to the grid and in a straight line so you could tell easily where the lines lead to.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds were very professional. The ""yes"" sound was similar to the success sound of a computer or a machine. The ""no"" sound also sounded like a robot machine sound. The experience was very polished and professional.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch was cleanly executed technically. They approached the coding assignment similar to the one done in class. The patch was easy to understand and professionally done. I could have added comments to my patch to make the experience less confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This user's patch was laid out differently from the previous patches I looked at. He did not use any buttons and instead of one audio input, had two. The patch was very refined and condensed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I enjoyed the good key sound, it was also ironic that the user choose the same good key as I did. On a conceptual note, the program was fun to work with. It was a good mix of goofy and fun.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I still found it interesting how the user strayed from the basic layout that was shown in class. I enjoyed how they completely eliminated the buttons from the patch, that definitely helped to clean up the patch and make it look more refined.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Pretty simple set up but easy to read and looks tidy. Minimalist and functional.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Easy to use and had some cool sounds. Made me want more sounds to play with and a audio sampler to start constructing some beats!,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Nothing too surprising here, they did add an additional speaker which was a bonus. Could have added some additional colors or notes to engage the user more. Another example of a good foundation but also a reminder to keep trying to find new ways to express patches in interesting ways.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It is very simple and very clean. The connectors are compressed and smooth. I like how clean this project is. However, the opening window was very large. I like that there is a comment stating what key opens the yes sound file, making it very easy for me to figure it out, but it states it's looking for the ""~"" key (126) when it is actually looking for the ""`"" key (96). It is interesting that there are two speakers though. Also, because it it compressed, it looked like the the sound meter was connected to the right bottom. It could be pulled down more, so it does not have that overlap.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was easy to figure out what key to type to find the (96) value. I was somewhat upset that it states it's looking for the ""~"" key (126) when it is actually looking for the ""`"" key (96). This is the only project that actually states what key it's looking for, so it makes it more user friendly compared to the other projects. Thank you. The sounds are simple.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The ending section could have been simplified with one speaker output rather than two.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is set up in two different max windows and might cause for some confusion, but it not too difficult to follow. The structure is still neat and flows well with good notation to tell the sound files apart.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"it feels good but the added step of having to turn on the audio manually kind of seems unnecessary than using the computers audio on off. The sounds are good and easy to tell which is good and which is bad. The ""bad"" key sound does keep playing even when the ""good"" key is pressed, not sure if it is suppose to be like that. I thought I was in the movie Jaws and having a sip of Kool-aid.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"They added some new aspects like sending a message outside of the patcher as to play the sound files. It was surprising but maybe a unnecessary in terms of functionality, but good in learning aspect. The message out was a good thing to see, as well as different.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Very simplistic of a design! I love it! The clutter from the other designs are essentially non-existent with this design.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The audio was enjoyable to hear; they were basic audio files that lacked creativity, but were better that ""yes"" and ""no"".",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The user took the time to condense the design to the simplest form I have critiqued so far; very enjoyable to see such an original and simple design. I learned that I could have condensed my own project even further to achieve the same results. The only thing I would like the creator of this patch to do better is to bring more enjoyable audio to future projects. Overall, great job! :)",,,,,,,,,,,
,Really nice. Great use of a sub patcher so that the presentation of the patch is nice and simple.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The bad sound was very entertaining. The good sound was very nice at giving positive feedback. However, I feel that the bad sound was a bit too long to get the intended experience.",,,,,,,,,,,
,They used a subpatcher which makes the entire process seem more streamlined to a user who may not have as much experience in Max/MSP,,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch looks incomplete.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch could not play. No sound no interaction.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Make sure the patch does work before submitting.,,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch does not look complete. It appears to be missing the majority of its components. I see only the speaker button and the top title key. I am curious to see if it will actually function properly.,,,,,,,,,,,
,I was unable to get this particular patch to work. The missing components were very necessary for this project. It stated which key to press but no sounds came out when I did so. There wasn't much of an experience with this patcher.,,,,,,,,,,,
,This patcher was poorly constructed. Many of the buttons were missing so it was unable to produce sound. One of the keys linked to another patcher. That patcher had a better set up but still failed to produce sound. I would recommend re-doing this patcher to get the hang of it. I was struggling initially but I just put up the tutorial video and it walks you through everything.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is also very compact and concise, consisting of only the music button and the main patch button. They tell me right away that ""C"" is the good key which takes away from the process of attempting to find the right one among all the buttons on the keyboard.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I try to turn the audio on, but it does not stay on so I cannot receive the sound from pressing the keys. I listened to the audio files on audacity, and the good one seems very bland with two different levels of clapping while the bad one has a slightly Terminator-like techno doom sound to it. As the audio button does not toggle I can't really say the experience is positive.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"They approached the assignment as it was done in class, though they added the specific audio level object into the patch. The patch probably works fine, but they just need to first debug it before submitting it as their final turn-in.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It didn't look complete.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It wasn't finished.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It felt like minimal effort was put into it and it looked that way for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It didn't feel all that good and was very confusing to work with to boot.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The creator seems to have approached it rather lazily as the sonud file didn't stop when another was played. It couldv'e been a lot more involved akin to how the lecture did it. What would also help is to put a note on how to work the volume on the patch.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Super Simplistic to look at. I had never seen the gain~ object so that was interesting. I cant help but feel that something is missing.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It didn't work.,,,,,,,,,,,
,I looks like a gameboard the way it is laid out,,,,,,,,,,,
,The sounds are goofy. It was fun to operate,,,,,,,,,,,
,Nothing out of the ordinary beyond the label graphics. Just another example of the basic tutorial for this assignment,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Initially, I was pretty impressed with the overall aesthetic. There was thought put into the placement of each object and also a color scheme that was present throughout the entire patch. Not only that but it felt like I was about to play a game. I was pretty excited especially with most of the text being in all caps!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was refreshing to see something that had character to it. Clearly it took some thought but it is still so simple and familiar. The sounds really surprised me. For some reason, I was expecting a human voice just saying the words but to have the actual animal noises was quirky and fun. Honestly, the goose sound is ridiculously satisfying. Overall, I had a lot of fun.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The coding is fairly efficient. The buttons may be unnecessary before the 'open' messages but I imagine they are more for the visual appeal. I did not know that you could create objects in different colors, I would really like to learn how to do this.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Looks very neat and organized. Very colorful.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It feels great to use. Even tried to make a game out of it. The sounds are very entertaining. Though the duck noise gets very annoying after a while. It was very goofy, yet beautiful at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This person approached the coding assignment very well. Yes, they did something surprising and exciting by making a Duck Duck Goose game out of it. Nothing really.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It looked different than other patches, and felt more welcoming.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The look was cool, graphic/text wise. The sounds were like a game of ""duck, duck, goose.""",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was an interesting take on the sounds, and I liked the basic look to the patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It feels nice and symmetrical but with some parts maybe being a little unnecessary.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The sound profile is definitely different and that makes it more enjoyable but there are still only two sounds. Overall I'd say it provides a decent experience to users.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Unfortunately, I think this may be the weakest part of this patch. In the open messages, it is not said what to open so you have to tell it yourself. An interesting thing they used is attaching a '0' to both play functions as a stopping method. I think they could have made this patch more efficient by cutting down on unnecessary objects such as two audio players.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The connectors are overlapping and there is a lot of clutter. It is a bit confusing. I cannot understand or follow what certain parts are suppose to do because there are no comments. I am unsure how to approach it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I am still unsure how properly to use the project. I tried to use the buttons and keys on the board, but I could not get either of the sounds to open. I was confused.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sound files are not opened in the project and there seems to be unnecessary pieces (the 0). This could also be simplified by only using one speaker output rather than two speakers and having two end points. In addition, there could be a sound meter, so that the user could see if there was a sound output or not.
 
 
 
 They could have left in the comments what key number 27 is.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch was complicated with quite a bit of extra stuff. There was no comments in the patch. The patch had a nice design to it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,I didn't get sound from the patch at all. I ran the window and it stated no file open.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch did not work at all. I would have cleaned up the patch quite a bit. I also would have added comments.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The overlook of the patch is quite different than the others, as this patch did not condense the good/bad key functions to automatically telling the patch to play the good or bad key prompts. Instead you would have to click on the open feature and choose the wave file in order for it to function. This is ok though, because we were not given the specification to take it further for simplification purposes. Although, aesthetically I feel if the patch was taken further and programmed this way then visually it would be easier to follow. The multiple lines interacting with both speakers (crossing over the open box) , etc., make it a little visually confusing to follow.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Conceptually it definitely flows in terms of functionality and visual appeal. It is designed in a way to be very user friendly, which allows for a strong user interface experience. I thought the bad key was really funny. It sounds like someone just making an angry sigh. The good key sound really did not invoke any feeling.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technically, as mentioned above I feel the functionally works fine for the assignment requirements. However, I feel if the additional measure was taken to create automatic buttons the active the good/bad key would have made it more user friendly and visually appealing. I definitely feel that you met the requirements of the assignment, I just challenge you next time to take it a little further for simplification of the user interface experience.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch isn't as clean as most of the others I have seen, however, that is also personal preference. The connections are very crossed and seemed tangled.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch was interesting, the user used the same sound as one my previous critiques did. The sound was goofy, which gives me the idea that the user is funny and goofy. The only problem I had with the patch was finding the good key.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch functioned pretty well and the coding seemed to be correct. The only issue I found was finding the good key and that the bad key sound was the ""ooh-yeah"" because it made it confusing for me. Overall, the patch did work and function well.",,,,,,,,,,,
,From the start the patch looks definitely more complicated than the others I've seen so far. It's clear that they assigned a couple of different sounds to multiple keys. I think this will be fun because that means there will be multiple bad key sounds rather than just one. Overall the patch looks a bit clustered but you can still make complete sense of what is going on.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well, listening to all the different sounds was a lot of fun, but I actually couldn't find the good key which makes me sad because I wanted to get to hear the sound. The sounds are very entertaining it was fun trying to figure out where they were from.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch is a very clean design for how much it looks like it can do. The look of it was thought out and the feel of the patch is very interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I love the sounds I think they are really entertaining and fun to play with. I kept pushing them to see what the right one was and It was fun! The only think I don't understand is what the ""yes"" key sound is. Either the sound isn't a clear yes or I just can't find the key which is really frustrating.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think the patch is technically very well put together although I'm not to sure what key is your yes key. It looks like it is number 1 on the keyboard which would be on a long keyboard but not a Mac. This is something you need to think about in your design especially while designing a game because if some users aren't able to play it to its full potential then it ruins the experience. I really liked how you connected all the numbers together to say different sounds I didn't know you could do that before. I think the only thing you need to work on is making a ""yes"" key that I can actually press.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks complicated. Many different number outputs are attached to each of the different sounds, all except one appearing to be different bad key messages.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is quite simple in its association of specific button numbers to each individual message and using it is fun because each audio clips is varied and hilarious. The bad key messages are all that will be heard, though, because there is no specific button for the good key message; I tried every button three times to make sure.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The programmer was very inventive in creating many different audio playbacks and linking them to specific keyboard presses. From viewing the patch I saw that they simply used the select command with the specific numbers of the different keyboard buttons and included them all while linking it to the open sound file command. The only thing that must be done differently is that one of them must be made the good key button.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch does look a little cluttered, but I am still able to figure out the flow. A lot of numbers on the screen may cause confusion.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch works great and the multiple sound files keep you entertained and the ""good"" key was hard to find because i'm sure a laptop keyboard does not have a home button. The Simpson's kept popping into my head the whole time while searching and then I found the ""good"" key and it was not something I expected, good surprise.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"They used the in-class template and added multiple sound files for certain keys. It was a nice change from the normal patch done in-class. I did learn how to incorporate multiple sound files from this patch. They could have organized it a little better, even by just spreading out the patch and giving each line some space, comments may have benefited here.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Right off the bat I am very overwhelmed with this patch. There are 27 different sound files present. But structurally, it seems to be pretty well organized and I do enjoy the fact that there is some color and text formatting in this patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I discovered that every letter key on the keyboard is assigned to a different one second snippet of a popular song, either singing ""ooh"" or ""mmm"". There are 26 different song snippets and one sound that plays when any other key is pressed other than a letter. Some of the songs I actually recognize and enjoy, so this patch was definitely entertaining. In fact, when you press a key that isn't a letter, a snippet of ""Mmm Bop"" by Hanson plays, which I found to be humorous.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really enjoyed the concept of this patch. It's definitely unique and it seems like it must have taken a lot of time to complete. I liked how he/she incorporated music into their project because it definitely held my interest. I think the aesthetics still could have been improved a little, and maybe it could have been organized in a way that isn't so daunting at first glance.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch has a little different of a layout than the patch I created, with a more horizontal approach.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The sounds are pretty entertaining and the patch was functional in the sense that there was one good key and the rest were bad.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The layout was a little confusing to figure out at first but it didn't hinder from the functionality of the patch. This patch made me look at setting patches up in different ways than what I would think.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch has several different clips from various different pieces of music. There are a lot of different ascii number codes that also correspond to each clip. Also with this patch, there is a comment that has a link to the Spotify playlist for every single song that is involved in this patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really enjoyed using this patch because I really love music and when I heard some of the clips that were used that I heard before someplace else, I smiled. The sounds were very entertaining to listen to. And I feel as though I had a lot of fun trying to figure out what sound corresponded to what key since there was so many of them.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The way how the patch was approached via coding was similar to the way that we were shown in class, but at a bigger scale with all the different sounds and all the different ASCII numbers that needed to be selected. Something that I learned from going over this patch was that it is possible to select multiple ASCII numbers for sfplay~ to use.",,,,,,,,,,,
,seems overly complicated.,,,,,,,,,,,
,frustrating. just like randomly switching radio stations.,,,,,,,,,,,
,they used the same concept in class but elevated it to a larger scale.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED LOOKING. The connections are all over the place and I read the comments for instructions, but honestly, I'm not sure I did it right.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well I managed to activate the first two sounds but had no idea what to do for the third one even after the comments. I just hit the open the STE-022.wav file and listened to it then and pressed other keys and realized that the third sound would still play while in conjunction to the other keys pressed. Also, I'm not sure what the sounds meant in relation to each other.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Definitely someone who knows what they are doing or has been coding with this stuff for awhile. I understood the first couple of rows and then, THEN, there was some fancy diverter box looking thing that changed the sounds or whatnot? I didn't get it to work. I learned that it is possible to continue looping a sound and not know how to turn it off other than muting the sound. Do better? Make it so the continuous sound would turn off..",,,,,,,,,,,
,It looked different than most of the patches.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds were a bit confusing, more than one going at one time and for a long period of time. I couldn't tell what the ""yes"" key was.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was interesting using more than one sound for the ""no"" key, however.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Very complex compared to the in class instructions.,,,,,,,,,,,
,At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think. Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It was really cool how it worked. You had to set the signals first and then select the right key and if wrong the signals would cross again.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is organized, but complex. It's not immediately obvious what everything does.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The experience of using the patch is both strange and humorous. The interspersion of very long and cryptic spoken clips, musical files, and recordings from class suggests a conceptual purpose that might be made more clear by a more elaborate explanation. Of course, the simplicity of the application doesn't demand as much intellectual engagement as it does interaction and exploration, so it ultimately feels like an interesting and successful version of the assignment.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The technical complexity of this patch is not as easy to explore or learn from as that of the others, but the patch is definitely an ambitious innovation on the instructions we received in class. The patch experiments with a complicated system whereby different inputs are connected to multiple outputs, and outputs are returned to between different inputs.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Looks a little complicated. Like there will be extra things happening for pressing one key. But i think it will be cool!,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like the narratives, chants, and excerpts from class that were put as sound files in the patch. However, I don't which is the good or bad keys. Maybe because it sounded so cool.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The code looked awesome. And it worked without me having to do anything extra.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is very colorful with every object having a different color fill, and the respective links also being those same colors. Those colors include red, green, blue, yellow, and of course the traditional gray. Due to the color coding the patch seems highly organized with no links seeming to blend in with others and confuse the user of what they are connecting.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The experience is quite interesting, and wholly unique in its itself from the other four I have critiqued, in that the goal is to find the sequence of keyboard presses that relay the sentence, ""Welcome, have a nice day."" Many buttons say the welcome part and the rest of the sentence comes sequentially with the right presses; ""A"", ""S"", ""D"", ""F"" will elicit the words. It's a very novel and fun concept, the dullness of each word takes away from it a little, and the lifeless pronunciation detract.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch, like many of the others, is very basic in design, with the specific key numbers being listened for for each word and the files connecting to the speakers. The use of color coordination is a great idea in hindsight as it adds an extra element of organization to the patch and creates more visual appeal for the user/viewer. More interesting sentences/livelier pronunciation of the words would greatly improve the project.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is a bit more colorful, where the ""open"" messages are concerned. There appears to be 5 different sound files.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch didn't actually work, at first. The sounds were in an additional folder, and wouldn't play. I had to move them to the same folder as the patch, as well as increase the volume using the slider that was input, before I got any feedback from the patch. The messages from the keys were, ""have,"" ""a,"" ""nice,"" ""day,"" and ""welcome."" If I didn't know anything about Max, this patch would have been useless to me, since it didn't work at the start and had no messages or comments for any steps to make it work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Overall, the patching was fine. Nothing super exciting, but having the sound files in a different folder led to an initial issue.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks extremely complex compared to what we learned in class, though it seems well organized.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I am not able to produce any sounds with this patch. There is an audio level bar that changes when i press buttons, yet I do not hear anything coming out of the speakers unlike the other Max patches I've seen.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This student seemed to add a lot and make something cool, still within the scope of what we learned in class. I learned that there is a lot you can do with just what we have learned, though I didn't learn how it works. It could have been made easier to understand for the average user, though the sounds don't work so it's hard to suggest anything.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Matthew definitely got creative with this one. My eye is automatically drawn to the five color coordinated segments in the middle of the patch, each with an assigned sound file below them. I am intrigued because above these segments it says ""Have A Nice Day."" Seems to be organized pretty well. Excited to try it out.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Not sure what's going on with this one, but the sounds are not working. Therefore my experience with this patch as a user was unsatisfactory.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I think conceptually this would have been an interesting idea if the sounds had actually worked. There must have been something wrong with the construction of this patch. Next time I would suggest checking to absolutely make sure that everything is working before submitting your project.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is well put together but there were a few things like the buttons that weren't really needed.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The ""no"" sound was kind of annoying after a while and the ""yes"" sound was kind of anticlimactic. With all of the screaming from the no keys I was hoping for a little more for finding the right one.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"technically, the patch is great, with a few things that could have been removed. Still it was just the patch that we were shown in class, nothing original about it except for the sounds.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is similar to that of the patch we saw in class. There are two branches, one for good key and one for bad key. There is one sfplay~ message, one ezdac~ message, and a meter. Both branches are labeled with Yes and No messages.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"While using this patch, I very clearly hear the difference between the sounds. The bad key sound was that of a person loudly screaming. The good key sound was that of a person yelling, ""Woohoo"". I would say that the sounds were somewhat silly, but the sound files were clipping and cracking which made it a very unpleasant experience when I was trying to find the good key. I liked the clear difference between the two sounds, but the quality of the audio was not very good.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch was coded in a similar way to that of the original we went over. The added labels of Yes and No did help me determine the different branches. Something that I learned after going over this patch, is to pay attention to the quality of sound, which was the only thing wrong with this patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch also looks basically identical to the example in class.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch feels exactly the same as the in-class example. The sound for the ""bad"" keys is some type of scream, and the ""good"" key sounds like Homer Simpson shouting, ""woo hoo!""",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patching and cords could have been cleaned up/organized a little neater. Otherwise, decent enough.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Looks as though it could be a little more organized.,,,,,,,,,,,
,There were no sound files included in the folder.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Split the good and bad signals to two different ezdac objects, which confuses me a little because I don't see a reason for it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I would've just used one speaker object instead of two, but to each their own. There also was a third one, unattached to anything at all. Just weird. Also, the .zip was just of a patch, and none of the associated files.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I wish I knew. There was no audio at all, as the audio files weren't included in the .zip.",,,,,,,,,,,
,There's some superfluous parts and also some critical parts missing - like the audio.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is layed out kind of similar to mine, but the layout is a little different than mine. Some of the the little boxes are in confusing places.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch recognizes the good key and bad key, but I was unable to hear the sounds when the keys were activated.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch uses the key selector and uses the open direct file location feature. The eazydac and meter arent working though.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch looked very disorderly, lacked comments, and had poor flow. It looked like it was tossed together quickly and with reckless abandon. The file folder was named poorly, with two file extensions(both .maxpat and .zip).",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch doesn't work. There were no sound files included in the file folder.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I couldn't tell if there was much of an approach made. This person's attempt failed, unfortunately, and there isn't much to show for their work other than a jumble of objects. In the future, they might find seeking help and double checking their work will help them out.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized, but you didn't attach the music file.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Because you didn't attach the music file, so I don't who which file that you picked.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Don't forget to attach the music file, otherwise everything is fine",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This one is appealing from the start because it is clean, linear, and tells me which key to press! I like the comments to all parts which help me understand what the author was going for.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch also takes me to the future. I enjoy the sounds which remind me of opening some kind of futuristic door. I have an easy experience as a user because they tell me which button to press.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Although visually appealing, it seems that they decided to create the patch without adding any of their own elements. I enjoy the buttons as visual additions to the audio output.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Another that looks identical to the in-class example.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Feels the same, because it basically was. The sounds are kind of like computerized blips. The ""good"" key has two tones which go up in pitch, whereas the ""bad"" keys go down.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Overall good, but organization could be a little neater.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Simply done. could have done without the 2 in sfplay. Other than that, it gets the job done.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was basically the example patch we did in class. However it used two cool sound fx's for the yes and no. The experience was good. Nothing I didn't expect,.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This person didn't really do anything surprising or new, and I didn't really learn anything new. Maybe they could have tried doing multiple sounds or something like that. Overall, it was what we were meant to learn and so it gets the job done. Good Job!",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is pretty straight forward and looks like what we did in class although the connections are distracting because of the placement.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is again very straight forward. The sounds aren't that exciting and don't really draw me into keep playing.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, there was nothing new added to this patch or nothing I could learn from it. It was very straight forward. If you could do something better it would be to add another concept to the patch and also make the sounds more recognizable as ""good"" and ""bad"".",,,,,,,,,,,
,Nice use of patch cord layout. Makes it seem a little more arty and less like a tool. As if the patch itself was part of the product as a whole instead of a tool.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Way to use alternative colors on your buttons! It stood out. The sounds were silly and fun. However, I had to hunt down the ""good"" key, as it wasn't a standard alphanumeric character ( ` ). It was a little out of the box and I appreciated it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I loved the layout and the color changes. It was proficient and fun. I might've liked to have seen some more reaching out in terms of numbers of keys and sounds, but I liked it otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Great patch. Everything is simple and clean.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like the sound for both good and bad keys. Very funky, cartoony sounds. Fun to listen to.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is good. I like the sound and it's clean.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Really nice. The feel of the patch is nice. A UI or use of presentation mode would have been nice.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The process seems very swift. The sounds are great.,,,,,,,,,,,
,I would utilize presentation mode to make the patch seem more functional to someone who has no idea what Max is. It was good that used the message boxes to open the file rather than make the user set up the patcher.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Pretty basic. No color, no text formatting, nothing particularly aesthetically pleasing about it. Seems to be well organized and includes clear instructions on the side of the patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I'm actually still laughing to myself as I'm writing this. The ""Bad Keys"" trigger a simple sound file of a little whistling noise accompanied by a man saying ""Nope."" But when I finally found the ""Good Key"" it played a long sound clip of a crazy EDM song with a guy going absolutely nuts for the song exclaiming ""YES!!! OH MY GOD YES!!!"" over and over. Aside from being hilarious, I'm also a fan of the EDM-dubstep genre which made me enjoy this patch even more.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The only thing that I would have changed are the aesthetics. Perhaps Stephanie could have added some different colors and text formatting to go along with the funny, quirky feel of the project itself.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The look of the patch is nice and clean, and very simple. Each part is explained very clearly as to show the viewer what each patch does, so there is no guess work when looking at it later.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The 'no' sound made me laugh a little and was a little goofy, but in a good way. The 'yes' sound was a bit loud, but it did give you a sense of triumph after button hunting. It was easy to use, and since there wasn't a label as to what the 'yes' key was there was key hunting. Thankfully, the 'no' sound wasn't obnoxious.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technically, the patch was very simple and nothing too complicated. Everything was simply spelled out so that there was no guess work as to what everything did. Since it was very basic there was nothing experimental added on to it, and nothing popped out as exciting. Just a simple little patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It looked pretty easy to understand and felt clean to boot.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It felt awesome, mainly due to the awesome choices in sound files. It was definitely a pretty entertaining experience, that's for sure!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"He approached it in a pretty creative way, and it definitely shows within the choice of the sound files. Don't have anything bad to say as it was pretty awesome and easy to understand.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch looked very similar to the example we did in class, except this student used two sfplay~ objects, and two ezdac objects.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I got no sound output from this patch, and couldn't figure out the cause for that error. The sound files were in the right folder, my computer volume was up, the ezdac was turned on, etc. It seemed that it should have worked, but alas it did not.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Cleaning it up a little would have been good, and making certain it works prior to uploading would also be good.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is set up nice and structured from top to bottom in nice format. Clearly tell where the patch will end up.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Unfortunately i was unable to hear the sound from the ""good"" key and ""bad"" key. In the ""open"" object they forgot to add ""open"" into the object, therefore it did not open the files. I did add to the ""open"" object and it works but because of the two speaker outputs, both good and bad sounds play while the other is playing.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"They went with the normal set up, but added another speaker at the end of the patch so there was one for both the ""good"" key and ""bad"" key, which seems redundant. Fixing the ""open"" object is the main thing I see that needs to be changed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Something doesn't look right. Two sfplay~ objects aren't necessary. Neither is two ezdac's. Has a nice flow to it, everything is labelled nicely.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It doesn't work. They forgot the open command on the message.,,,,,,,,,,,
,They could have wrote the patch correctly so it could work.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is very similar to the patch that we went over in class. The main difference is that instead of one sfplay~ message and one ezdac~ message, there are two for each branch, and there isn't a meter within the patch. Everything in this patch is labeled with a message box.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch was very easy to use, especially because of the label that is right next to the desired ASCII number code for the good key. The sounds had a very clear difference on which was good and which was bad. Good key was an audience cheering. Bad key was the audience booing. Although, I feel as though the sounds were too long and tended to overlap a lot, especially the good key sound. Yet, the open message for the sounds were not originally in front of the sound files, so the patch was missing this.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"As I mentioned before, this patch was missing the open message in front of the sounds. It is a very easy mistake to make, but it renders the sound files useless since Max will not just open the sound files on its own. From going over this patch, I learned that I would need to double check my patches in the future so that I don't forget something. Even if it's just one mistake, the patch is not going to function correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"From first glance, this patch looks like a standard good key bad key layout.",,,,,,,,,,,
,One thing I noticed was that this patch had 3 good keys rather than 1. They did this by putting in a few different numbers in the key selector thing.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch uses the open files direct location to open the wav sounds. Since there are a few good keys, the keys specific code number are put in the key selector.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch itself looks very well set up. It appears to contain all the necessary components and has a clear picture of what keys need to be pressed.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds were so funny and enjoyable but they would not be produced by hitting the keys. I had to click on the sound buttons themselves on the patcher to hear the sound. Though it looks to have everything that is needed, clearly something is missing or some important step was skipped.",,,,,,,,,,,
,They approached the assignment with all the right thoughts no doubt however the outcome failed to show it. The set-up looks right but there was probably one small missed step. I would recommend re-doing it and watching the tutorial while your doing. That is what helped me so much but even I still did struggle. Its best to do it perfectly once so they can learn from their mistakes.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"At first I was a little confused by the patch, however the comments that were added allowed me to figure out what was happening without much effort. Kudos for that.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds are great. I would have gone for a shorter ""fail"" sound since you end up hearing it over and over, but overall, good sound choices. The patch is simply constructed, however in my opinion, the creator could have taken more care to line things up according to the grid.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"There is nothing wrong with the sketch, however, I would have put the number selector on the other inlet for the ""select"" object, that way the user can change what key is the ""success"" key.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The filing was good and the folder named. The patch could be cleaned up a bit. The patcher is nicely labeled with comments.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch only works if I push the switches not the actual numbers indicated.,,,,,,,,,,,
,I think it could be slimmed down a quite a bit,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The report format is good. Try and label the equations below and state when you use them in the theory. Also its hard to tell if you used Microsoft equation editor, looks like it is, but I am not 100% sure. Refer back to for example: equation 1.a was used. Add some more details on the theory, study, and conclusion. Overall it is looking pretty solid. Just some brushing up on the theory and how you coded it into MATLAB.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Good! but you need to verify your code with a manual/hand calculation on the side to compare to what MATLAB outputs.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Overall very well written. Goes in depth on the two equations two unknowns section and circle explanation. However, part of the project is to play around with the circle graphing code and to generate multiple sets of systems of equations. Seeing more examples would be nice just to see how the code plays out in different scenarios. 
 
 
 
 2. Overall, I would give a 3/5 for completion and 5/5 for explanations and writing style.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"For your report, you only partially completed the report. The Introduction needs to have both a problem statement and a description of the study, you should expound upon what you have. I do like your theory because you actually showed some of the mathematics of Newton's Method, but again you should explain the theory a bit more in depth, maybe go into more about the derivation because there is more to say. You have some evidence in your Study and Results, but try to explain all the things your code accomplished including the polynomial results and your own unique nonlinear equation's results. I think you could use the addition of more images, also make sure you create circles in your picture that match what the CP 1 Notes ask for. Once you have completed your report, you need to update your conclusion. I would also like to point out that you should have three codes for this computing project in your appendix, first is the polynomials given in the CP 1 Notes, second is the code for the two circles (which you have), and the third should be your own code with unique nonlinear equations. Don't be afraid to explore the computing project more!",,,,,,,,,,,
,You need to repeat the code from the notes as well as do your own exploration of a system that you come up if. I would focus more on Newton's Method than saying things about how it is a refresher on MATLAB and stuff like that.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I liked your report and really seemed like you knew what the project was all about. The conclusion should be longer than a sentence long, try going back to your introduction and reflect back on it. Tell weather or not the we were able to complete the purpose of this MATLAB project, then why or why not? Something along those lines, so it can help length that sections a little longer than a sentence. Other than that it was a good one :)",,,,,,,,,,,
,Your theory included all of the equations used in the project. In order to enhance you project think about adding more to your study and results. This section is suppose to be where you explain all of your findings though the use of the code you created. Show the reader what the plots look like that you are talking about in your study. Explain a little bit about each manipulation you made to your code and what you observed from each manipulation. Then summarize all of your findings in the conclusion. Also add a code verification section to your report to ensure your code is working as it should be.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like your introduction. It introduces the Idea of what I am going to expect in the report and makes a clear understanding of what you will show throughout it, nonlinear equations. For the Theory, in your matrix, your second term in the top left equation is supposed to be 3x^2-3y+1 and you have 3x^2-3y^2+1 so check that and correct it. You also may want to include the two equations used in the matlab code so that we see what the two circles' equations are. Your code looks good, however you do not have anything in there about the two points of intersection. There is a part of the report that says: ""Note: this is the problem of finding the points of intersection of two circles."" I think that is important so I would add them and graph it so that the two points are highlighted. Also add that to your report and state what happens when you guess too far from the actual values. In your conclusion, It would be good to put something in there on your results of the code trials and anything that you think wraps up the tests done in matlab such as why there should be a maximum number of iterations for the program, the tolerance of the guesses, and then sum up what the nature of the convergences you found are. The last thing that should be added is the two equations that you made up on your own. The last thing that the report asks for says to propose your own nonlinear equations and have matlab solve them for you.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"After reading over your report I feel that overall it is well organized and is reader friendly.
 
 In the introduction you can expand more one what Newton's Method is so that it ties in more on what the project is all about. 
 
 In the theory, I believe there are suppose to be 3 graphs. You need to go back and look at the what CP1 is looking for. You have one graph that looks correct but you need to display the intersection point. Under the graph you need to label each figure and have a description of each graph. The 2 others graphs you need to have has to show an increase in radii and another showing 1 solution.
 
 In the study and results section, first off you should capitalize ""Study and Results"" to look more professional. In addition, your second sentence should be rewritten because it is hard to follow. Reread the second sentence and reword it. Other than that it looks good and has good depth in the section. 
 
 In the conclusion section, it seems a little short. You can expand on what you learned and how it scientifically relates to our studies. Possibly talk about Newton's Method here too.
 
 In the appendix, I ran the code and it worked. Once again, you need to display other graphs (look back at the CP1 guidelines).",,,,,,,,,,,
,"For starters, when submitting projects for peer review use your posting ID and not your name. 1.a) (points: 2) your equations are correct and look formatted correctly, however your going to need to add more details about how these equations are correct, show why you used the equations you used and why they work the way they do. b) (points: 1) The bulk of the program is correct, however you didn't output the intersection points of the two circles or show the plot of where they intersect. c) (points: 0) No evidence of Code Verification d) (points: 1) majority of program correct missing intersection points. 2. a) (points: 2) Your study and analysis of the problem has been grasped, however I would go into more detail about the relationships of the equations. b) (points:3) You did go into depth about the relationship between connected and unconnected circles and newtons method. c) (points:1) more information about new observations. d) (points: 1) need more scientific evidence 3) a) (points:2) Decent read, could have more depth in each category b) (points: 2) more depth c) (points: 1) build a better conclusion that ties in the entire project d) (points: 1) report needs to be more professional Point Total: 17",,,,,,,,,,,

 Total Points: 28",,,,,,,,,,,
,I think that you have a good start on your computing project. One thing that i would work on is to add a few more examples of outputs of your code in the study and results section. You did a good job of showing where the circles have only one intersection point but i think it would be important to show how your code works with other examples of functions. I like how you displayed your equations in the theory section and really went into detail describing what every part of the equation means. Another thing that i would add to your report is the verification of your code. One way to do this is to pick simple functions that can be worked out by hand and solve them yourself and compare your answer to the answer MATLAB gives you. Another thing I would do is go back through your introduction and conclusions and make sure that they are smooth to read. I felt like there were a few sentences that could be written a little smoother and be easier to read. All in all i feel like you have a good grasp on the ideas of the project and have a good start to your project.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"- Good but you need to write in Third-person format and not in First-person. 
 
 - Your graph should show the iterations to the intersection as well.
 
 - Code needs to be verified with a manual calculation that it works¦for example: calculate the intersections of the two circle equations and compare that MATLAB outputs for the intersection, they should be the same..that could verify that your code works.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The graph should have dots showing exactly where the circle intersect.,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Introduction: Link your sentences.
 
 Theory: Well labeled and use of Figures.
 
 Code Verification: Well done. Could have made easier using WolframAlpha.

 Conclusion: Great, succinct.
 
 Code: Well organized",,,,,,,,,,,
,"-Your ""Code Verification"" section was well done. It was unique and also intelligent, for you didn't just verify the code by hand but you tested MATLAB. 
 
 -You stuck to 3rd person, which kept your writing very professional. 
 
 -One thing I would suggest adding is talking about what ""quadratic convergence"" means in your study section. The second to last paragraph in the Computing Project 1 pdf suggests you discuss some things about setting a maximum number of iterations and such and I could not find your comments on it in your report.
 
 
 
 Otherwise, it was very thorough and great job!",,,,,,,,,,,
,Nicely laid out and good explainations,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Good overall, more organization well make it perfect.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hello,
 
 
 
 Your report was well written and straight to the point. Well done. You could have expanded a bit more on the results you obtained when you inputted a different equation. But other than that, it was a really good report. 
 
 
 
 Congrats!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The code has shown a warning. However, it can be happening because it is copied from a PDF document.
 
 The report is well organized and presented. It could be smaller than what it is, because it has unnecessary information. For example, it talks about the situation in which it is chosen the center of the circle as a guess, but it does not explain why Newton's Method does not work in this situation.
 
 It could be written with less information than it has. Being more specific.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Overall I thought your report was very detailed and well laid out. I could easily understand what the project was about. the introduction was very good. The only part I was slightly confused on was your theory. It might be beneficial to have a different section for code verification just to make the theory a little more clear. Also it would be nice to see what numerical values the code produces for some of the plots.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The report contained the equations implemented in the code. The report also introduced and explained Newton's method and gave the reader a good background of the concept and equations. The code was verified and different computations were done to show the program was exercised in different ways. The quality of the report was great as it gave the description of study. The presentation was great as well and was a good read. The conclusions connected to study too.,,,,,,,,,,,
,This is the kind of report I wish I could produce. Great Job! Well explained. Well thought out report.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In this computing project report the introduction is very simple but at the same time it include the most important points of the project. Also the theory is correct and in specific explanation by using equations and graph of circles in one and two intersection solution. I thing this report in very good for other to follow the progress of the author. In all, this report have a great detailed explanation but at the same time it can be improved more.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This Computing program report contains good explanation of the goal for doing the project. Also the theory is correct and in specific explanation by using equations. This report has very detailed writing about code verification. I think this report is very easy for other to understand and follow the progress of the author. One thing that this report can be improved is providing the intersection of the circle that has only one solution. In all, this report is very good on detailed explanation.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technical Accuracy: Introduction is informative, Theory is correct, Code is verified and running correctly and computations are done. Good Job.
 
 
 
 
 
 Interest and Insight: The study is good so far but I think you can do better by finding situations in which Newton's method only finds one solution or where no solution is found. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Quality of Report: It is a well written report but i don't think you're quite done yet. Very good so far though.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your introduction is clear and to the point of what we are trying to grasp through this first project. I think you need to introduce a little bit more of Newton's method in this section, however. We understand that we are using his equation to find the intersecting points, but give a little background about how we go about introducing variables and such in this section. In your theory, how does this program go about testing conditions and finally come about outputting the closest answer to the intersection? In your study and results it seems that you are a little confused on the out put in your figure 1. The resulting circles are not due to your g1 and g2 equations. The resulting intersection points are computed through these equations. You should define your circles in your report with the equations that you did in the code. Your c1 and c2 equations cause the red and blue circles to appear. You also need to look over your initial points in your figure 2. You don't mention anything about the two circles only having one solution. In your code it appears that every time you ran it there was always two solutions where the circles intersect. in order to make it so there is one solution you need to relocate your coordinates of your circles and adjust the radii so they only intersect in one place. You conclusion also needs to connect with your introduction a little bit more.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This report has the right theory for this project. And it has organized program in order to run it. also most of the code are correct and has error need to recode it. This report has all the objectives. And it need to complete in different sides of the project. Conclusion is including all related objectives for this project. I really like the style that when he or she started this report in ordered way,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Introduction and Theory are great, I would change the format of arranging your equations so that the T.A doesn't mark you off (equation should be to the far right of the page of the equation).

,I really like how organized and professional your whole report looks. You really formatted all of the information well and made it look really nice. Your introduction and conclusion were written very nicely and describe what you are trying to prove in your report well. You did a good job describing how you verified your code with other sources so you knew that the answers it computed were correct. I also thought you did a good job at testing different functions in your code and showing the different results that you observed. You explained each test and what you were trying to find very well and made it easier to understand what was happening with the different tests.

,Your code is working just fine and was verified with the graphs and information that you had in the report. You did a good job explaining how Newton's Method is used and how it needs a starting point to find the solution. The report was organized and easy to read.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In the technical accuracy theory part of your report, make sure to write the main equation we are going after which is x=xo-[gradient(g(xo)]^-1*g(x). Also, if your starting point was at the center of one of the circles, it becomes singular, which means it couldn't possible have one solution. Check and see what's your possibilities of having one solution.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Technical accuracy - Great job your explanation of newtons method was very well thought out
 
 
 
 2. Depth Interest - while the original problem that was solved went into some detail i think you only scratched the surface of what the program can do. You should expand on how the program can be useful in other circumstances. IE. if the circles only have only one intersection point what happens to the program? over all good job
 
 
 
 3. Your report was very easy to read and i thought that everything you wrote tied together well. i think that the report needs some work in looking more professional. maybe by making the headings bold or using a report template to make the whole report seem more appealing to the eye.
 
 
 
 I enjoyed reading your report and the way you explained the theory of the project gave me some ideas on how i can improve my own report 
 
 thanks and good job",,,,,,,,,,,
,There are small grammatical errors throughout the report which could be cleared up with a little extra proofreading. Possibly try to delve in to how Newton's Method can be used for applications outside of the intersection of two circles. Also could use some more calculations to explain the equations involved with the method itself. Create your own set of equations to be solved and analyze those as well.,,,,,,,,,,,

,One thing that you can add to your report is implementing both the results and the graphs that you received when changing the centers and radii of the circles. You touched on it briefly in the report but it is nice to also show visuals of these things to further support your report. Another thing that i think you can improve upon in your report is the verification of your code. You should either hand calculate or use another calculation program to test the equations you use in your code to be sure that both the MATLAB code solution and the other solution are the same. I think that you did a nice job displaying your equations in the theory section and describing what they are. I think that if you provide some more visuals of the results and graphs you got when testing your code and provide more evidence of your code verification you will have a good overall report.,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Hello,
 
 A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use:
 
 -Under theory, I would suggest showing the derivative of the equation of the circle.
 
 -Try experimenting a little bit, and document anything interesting (i.e. if two circles can have just 1 interception point, or what happens when you change the centers, and radii).
 
 -Try to have your conclusion tie into your study and results. Conclude information that you discovered through running the program (and trying different ideas)
 
 P.S.. Nice formatting and cover page/contents page!!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"For your report, you have a partially complete report. In the Introduction you have a problem statement but you also need to include a description of the study, you should expound upon what you have already. I don't like your theory too much because you didn't actually explain anything about Newton's Method, you should try to explain the theory and mathematics behind the derivation of Newton's Method, take a look at the notes on Blackboard. You have some evidence in your Study and Results, but try to explain all the things your code accomplished including the polynomial results and your own unique nonlinear equation's results, not just about the two circles. I think the addition of some more images would be very beneficial to your report. Don't forget about the ares of Depth and Significance, New Observations, and Scientific Competence. Once you have completed your report, you need to update your conclusion. I want to mention how well presented your report it, it looks very nice! I would also like to point out that you should have three codes for this computing project in your appendix, first is the polynomials given in the CP 1 Notes, second is the code for the two circles (which you have), and the third should be your own code with unique nonlinear equations. Don't be afraid to explore the computing project more!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hello,
 
 A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use:
 
 -In figure 4, you set the point of convergence directly at (2,0), which is the exact point of interception.. What happens is you try two starting points, lets say at (-2,-2) and (6,-2)? Do they converge to the same interception point at (0,2)? They should!
 
 -I would recommend having the points of interception plotted onto all of your graphs as well, just an idea.
 
 -Try to have your conclusion tie into your study and results. Conclude information that you discovered through running the program (and trying different ideas)
 
 -When copying your script to Microsoft Word, try to keep the colors (green, blue, etc.) from your m-file to show on Word as well.
 
 p.s... I really liked the introduction/theory, with all the background information about Newton, and why this method is helpful!! Very nice work, with lots of responses to the questions they asked!",,,,,,,,,,,

,"Technical Accuracy
 
 For introduction: It is understood that it is a great method for this course, but how and why will we go about utilizing it? Why not use Wolfram alpha or a calculator? 
 
 For theory: All the equations are great, but they need explanations. They seem to be labeled (1-10) yet they are not all referenced in the text. The program is also not verified; maybe create a problem scenario where the answer is obvious and use the computer to produce the desired result.
 
 
 
 Interest and insight
 
 Good depth through the creation of the extreme scenarios; i.e. no intersection points or a single intersection point. Were there any new observations?

,"For the introduction, some more information should be added to it to explain what I will find in the report. You have a basic explanation but it's kinda jumbled in a small paragraph. In the Theory section there are a lot of unnecessary equations. #9 and 10 are okay to have. You can also have added the tangent matrix equations. In the study section you should talk about the different studies and results of those studies. In the conclusion, there should be a description of the dynamics in the report. You should definitely put more in the study and conclusions.",,,,,,,,,,,

,"After reading your report I feel that overall you report looks good because it is reader friendly and is well organized. I feel that you can expand on your intro, study and results and conclusion as they are on short side and can be expanded on more in-depth. 
 
 In the introduction section, you can tie in what Newton's Method so that you can relate back to it later in the report.
 
 In the theory section, you give a good visualization on what equations you used. The graph should be in the study and results section.
 
 In the study and results section, this is where the graph should be. In addition to your graph, you should be displaying intersection points. Also, you should have two other graphs, one showing an increase in radii and another showing 1 solution. 
 
 In the conclusion section, you need to go more in-depth on how it scientifically relates to the study and the class. You can also incorporate what Newton's Method is and how it ties into this project.
 
 In the appendix section, I ran your code and it worked. You need to go back and modify it to display intersection points on the graph you plotted. You also need to go back and modify the code to create two other graphs showing an increase in radii and another showing one solution.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"You're theory is well written but you could include a few more equations. For example, you show the Taylor series in its shortened form with just the first two terms, but you should also show the fully expanded Taylor series so people can see what it actually is. All in all though, it gives some good insight into the problem and presents what you are doing very effectively.
 
 
 
 I plugged your code into MATLAB and it worked without errors so your code is verified and you did a good job of performing your computations on Wolfram Alpha and the graphs were helpful.
 
 
 
 Your Study & Results section is very informative and you do a great job of describing what each graph shows. You include graphs of two circles intersecting at 2 points, intersecting at one point and not intersecting at all which is exactly what the project asked you to do so good job there.
 
 
 
 Overall, I would say you pretty much touched on everything you were supposed to in this project. The only thing you have left to do now is proofread the entire report because there are grammatical errors in your sentence structure in some places. Other than this I think your project is great. I like the presentation style you chose, including the cover page, page borders and the colored page numbers on the corners.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"After reading your report, overall I feel that it is the most professional looking report I have come across so far. It is well organized, is reader friendly and goes into detailed depth in the study and results section.
 
 In the introduction, I feel it is a little short. You can expand upon this section on what Newton's Method is.
 
 In the theory section, everything looks great. I really like how everything is displayed and is easily readable. All the figures have captions which gives the reader a good understanding on what is going on in the report.
 
 In the study and results section, I like how you incorporated the non linear graphs and all of the graphs with captions giving a good visual on what this report is about.
 
 In the conclusion section, I feel you can elaborate more on Newton's Method and how it relates to out project and scientifically relates to applied engineering.
 
 In the appendix section, I ran you code and everything looked great.

,"1. Technical accuracy-I liked your introduction, you did well in explaining the importance of newtons method and why we need to numerically integrate some functions. but i think you need to add some explanation to your theory rather than just having several equations that we really don't know where they came from or how they are going to be used in solving the problem presented. I think if you added some comments about how those equations will be used in the program you will get a lot more credit in this section.
 
 
 
 2. Depth of Interest- In your original study you did a good job in explaining what newtons method does ( this is the sort of explanation you might put in the theory part of your report). but you didn't go into very much depth in finding out what the program was capable of computing. for example what happens if the circles don't intersect? what does the program do? how could you change the program to find both intersection points at the same time? i think adding some of these questions and answers to your study and results would prove very beneficial.
 
  
 
 3. Quality of the report- Over all your report was well organized. i know this is just a rough draft so you might consider using a report template in word for your final report. Also naming your figures IE figure 1, figure 2, will allow you to recall figures without having to use them over and over again. it also helps the reader match figures with what is being talked about.",,,,,,,,,,,

 -You did a lot of extra discovery (i.e. 1 interception point, and no interception points). I would suggest doing a little more written work to show what you discovered, and why these things happen, not just the m-files.
 
 -I would recommend having the points of interception plotted onto all of your graphs as well, just an idea.
 
 -Try to have your conclusion tie into your study and results. Conclude information that you discovered through running the program (and trying different ideas).
 
 -You may want to try to correlate the fonts. Some of them seem to be different sizes.

 Your theory needs to go more in depth about what Newton's method is and how it uses a Taylor series. There are plenty of notes on the courses' blackboard page that describe how Newton's Method works and you should include a lot of that information in your report including the equations and graphs it shows.
 
 
 
 Obviously your study and results section was lacking what it needed because your code wasn't working so make sure you get that code working and then you will need to include at least three or four graphs in that section. One with two intersections, one with no intersection and one with an intersection at one point.

,"Your report is short and concise and really describes what it is you did very well. The only thing I can say is you should elaborate on some parts.

Also, go into a little more detail about how Newton's Method works. That it uses estimations and a Taylor series to estimate nonlinear functions.
 
 
 
 You code easily copied and pasted into MATLAB and generated two graphs and showed the iterations to find the intersection point without any error so your code is verified. Once again, your study and results is informative but could include a little more such as how Newton's Method works using a Taylor Series for a nonlinear function.

All of your graphs and outputs look correct and good, but you should discuss what these graphs are telling the reader.

Also you should describe the different tests that you ran while testing your code and what you observed while doing the tests. You did a good job at displaying the results and graphs that you received from your different tests however i would be careful about just taking the outputs directly form MATLAB and putting it in your report. You should formulate a table in a word document or other useful programs that generate plots and copy that plot into your report.

,"Hello,
 
 A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use:
 
 -I would suggest using the grading criteria, and rubric as a guide. Include sections in your report (Introduction, Theory, Study and Results, Conclusion, and Appendix).
 
 -Include some figures (and/or tables) to give the reader a visual of what is happening.
 
 -Give a brief introduction of what this report is going to detail, along with the theory behind everything (i.e. In the Theory section, you could include the equation of a general circle, and the derivative of the general circle, as that was used in the m-file).
 
 - While in your conclusion section, try to correlate what you discovered in the study and results section.
 
 p.s. Everything you wrote seemed to be correct (at least to me), you just need to use some section titles, and format a little bit. Add a few figures, and you should be set!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"First off i think that you should split up sections with titles and headers, that way we can tell whats different from introduction, to study and results and so on. This looks more like a very rough draft of your report than what should be closer to your final draft. You introduction should not contain any equations or any methods as this should be saved for your theory. It doesn't quite look like you have a results and study section. To me it looks like your code does not even work properly and you just threw together a report for credit. The main purpose of this report is to input the output of what matlab produces when you run your code. You should insert about three graphs, one for each part of the code you should have ran. Even the part that you have, you definitely need to read over and correct some grammar mistakes. You need to verify you code by going through some of your solutions and explaining how matlab goes about coming up with the output that it did. Then you also need to explore more by creating your own nonlinear equations and inputing those into your matlab code and see what the output gives you. Overall this is a pretty bad report and needs to completely redone.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Include the sections of the report and write the specifics in the sections. The sections includes an Introduction, Theory, Study and Results, and Conclusions. Label your equations and refer to them in your report. Refer back to for example: equation 1.a was used here. Save the images that MATLAB produces and put them in the correct section, study and results and label them and refer to them. Re-read your paper and correct grammatical errors and sentence structure. Overall you need to put some more work into this report!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your introduction is solid and gets to the point for this project. In your theory, you need to describe how you came about with the equations that you have in there. Describe the process about going through inputing the equations into matrix and what you expect these equations to produce for you by inputing them in your code. You also need to describe the process about going through the code and generating the circles in your plots. With out knowing how these are produced, someone reading your report would not be able to recreate or understand about how these circles were generated. I think you need to read through your code verification again. Rememebr that these plots of the two intersection points are only estimates about the solution of the two intersections. They are not completely exact as taylor series is more of an estimation process. In your code it is important that the point is to test many solutions in order to get the correct one. Instead of looking at the graph and than assuming where the intersection was and using that as your initial condition, try testing a different solution and see how matlab goes about using the code and finding the correct location of the two intersections.",,,,,,,,,,,

 In the theory section, you need to show calculations and derive your equations. This section seemed a little short so you can expand on this here.

You have some evidence in your Study and Results, but try to explain all the things your code accomplished a bit more. I think including the images showing your results is very useful. Also, you should consider removing the lines of code after your unique nonlinear function, it is very distracting. Once you have completed your report, you need to update your conclusion. I would also like to point out that you should have three codes for this computing project in your appendix; the first is the polynomials given in the CP 1 Notes, second is the code for the two circles, and the third should be your own code with unique nonlinear equations.

 In the theory section, it seems unfinished. You are right that you have to show the derivations of the your equations but you need to elaborate on what all that is. To the reader, I do not know what all that means. You need to state how it relates to Newton's Method.
 
 In the study and results section, this is were you explain how you came across your graphs and what each graph means.

Also, some adjustable numbers would maybe work better is they were set in bounds. That way it eliminates the possibility of breaking the song. Other than that, I thought it was a wonderful patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch looks very basic, following the same layout as the example that was shown in class. With that said, it's well organized and is very simple to make work. On top of that I like the addition of the midi keyboard to visually see what notes are being played. 
 
 
 
 This patch works by clicking on the toggle object, which then goes through the counter and then goes on to select the commanded notes, all while giving a visual display on the keyboard. The metro serves as the metronome in this patch, keeping everything on a steady rhythm.
 
 
 
 Well you can't be human and dislike this melody... Seriously just hearing this classic tune through the ""bleep"" sounds made me happy. Very simple and to the point! 
 
 
 
 Perhaps an improvement to this would have been to add the bass section, so instead of just the lead melody it will sound more like a full band.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is a pretty cool little patch, and you did a good job recreating the melody. I might try adding in chords to add interest, but good job overall.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Based off of the description that was written for this project, it was very clear for me to determine what the goal was. Due to how simple the goal was put, there was no possible way for me to misunderstand what the author was trying to accomplish.
 
 
 
 The way that the patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the toggle. The toggle then activates the two buttons and two metro objects which then activate the counters on each side. The counters are attached to two different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1 to 8 and 1 to 6, with 8 and 6 buttons on each side. These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a message attached to each input and a combination of a kslider, a makenote object, and a noteout object. In case the notes are stuck, there is a flush message attached to each kslider in order to wipe the messages clean for the notes to start over.
 
 
 
 The author created a simple song with the use of 2 different set of notes. Their sequencer branched out into two different sides, one representing the left hand, the other representing the right hand. The left hand had chords, or played many notes at one time, while the right hand played single notes. After going over this patch, I thought that it was well made. The layout is very clear to understand and is very efficient at achieving its goal. I hardly see any fault with it.
 
 
 
 My only concrete suggestion is to possibly avoid having duplicate numbers in the chord messages.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The author made a very nice, simple max patch. The song isn't recognizable to me (not that that's imperative). Very interesting that the author decided to use a different, yet proportionate time scale between the two sequencers. It reminds me of an old fashioned, mechanical sequencer.
 
 
 
 A cool way to improve this would be to 
 
 1. Add a presentation mode
 
 2. Add a way for the user to change time count and pitch value.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very good sequencer. I like how you did to pianos at the same time. The patch was very easy to understand, especially since you labeled it. Had a very happy sound to it. I can't really think of anything that might need fixing. Though the song does sound off at some points, but it's probably supposed to sound like that.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch had a very interesting sound and I liked it. The dissonance sounds very cool and it made me feel a little bit creeped out.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The layout is easy to follow and very visual with the slide out keyboard. Having the buttons light up makes it easy to follow where the music is and the notes in number form. The comment boxes help guide what is going on as the user looks through the patch. The patch works via the kslider and the notes shown in the message box, with chords clearly listed in number form of the keys. I would say there is a melody and a harmony, playing at the same time but to a different metronome. I read that it is not really a song, but it is not bad to listen to, I think the last couple notes in the harmony sound a little off but it still works.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Truly fantastic. I like that the author decided to go with a graphic sequencer.
 
 I'm not exactly sure how the author made this as I am an amateur Max user. The author seems to have programmed a sort of coordinate system which is really impressive to me. It was nice to visualize exactly what would play. The only thing I would ask for is the author to include a presentation mode and a sort of highlighter that went along with the beat on the graphic.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The work looks like some sort of sequencer based upon dots on a grid. As you change which dots on the grid are active, the sequence of notes and combination of notes changes. Lastly, changing the metro changes the speed, higher metro is a lower repetition rate of the notes. After the sequence, there is a code sequence that reads the number output on the grid and changes those numbers into the sounds we hear. there is an additional patch that the author created, but I do not understand its purpose completely, it may control the grid. I think it is very conceptually pleasing, allowing for a high amount of interaction between the user and the art, although the sounds may not be the most joyous to hear. I would suggest different note structures playing different songs to visualize the song coming together, perhaps each column being a different chord and each row a different instrument, similar to logic.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It looks very flashy and nice. Although it looks pretty complex once you read the instructions it becomes easier to use. I like how there is a clear button for the program as well.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It looks like a very cool patch. I like the interaction with the different tempos and different variations of responses. I guess the only thing would be that I did not understand the musical aspect.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This sequencer was well made and easy to understand for the most part. Intersections within the constructed matrix are played when the user selects them, which produces the notes. The sequencer has a 8-beat metronome in which the notes are paced.. The sequencer can be altered for looping and changing of speed for note playing. The sequencer was creatively thought out, but I would suggest that the design were made slightly simpler for others in the class to understand. For most, the class is an introductory course and we have yet to cover matrix objects in the classroom. But excellent work above all else!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was very simple to understand due to labeling. The sound was very annoying after a while, but I was impressed by how you changed to BPM at some points. The thing that I would suggest is to try and make it sound more like a song instead of just random sounds.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This work is pretty simple but it's intricate and makes the beeps change tempo after a while. Everything works fine technically, the buttons all go to one or another number value. It made me feel very calm, it wasn't anything too crazy or too simple, just a simple project. There is nothing I think you could improve on with this project.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is appears to be simple, but it is very organized. At first glance, I was a little confused where there were two metro and ""make a bleep"" objects/sub-patches, but after a little testing I realized that they did actually change the song in a tangible manner, both adding beats and changing the tempo. The patch works by simply clicking the starter button, and a counter and select object feed key numbers to the make a bleep patch at continuous intervals, creating a simple 8-10 note tune. The song was pleasurable to listen to. It had a nice melody and the notes meshed together nicely. A suggestion to improve the work would be to include some notes that tells the viewer, and the author itself, what parts do what. It would have been nice to see that as I think the whole critiquing process is a potential learning experience for the critics.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The description of the patch is pretty spot on. I enjoyed the fact that this person decided to use two different metros to alter the tempo throughout the course of the 8 notes. This gives it a little something extra and shows that he/she tried to take it a step further than the bare minimum that was required. The composition itself is not exceptionally pleasing to the ears because of the constantly changing notes and tempos, but all in all the patch was clear, straight-forward, and well organized. The only thing that I maybe would have done differently is created a composition that appeals to the ear more by means of a good solid melody, but that's just me.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This Particular Patch looks very impressive. It is well laid out and organized and by looks I'd give it an A. The sound was very good and super fun. I was very happy with the sound itself and though the buttons and colors would have been cool, I think it was well done. But this has much potential so yes i would decorate it up more.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is very well organized, the buttons conveying the bang command arranged in a zig-zag manner that keep the blinking going through a continuous motion. The two sequencers are situated side by side in a branching fashion, with the number messages' connections all going into the number box to produce the notes. A single toggle and metronome command control both. Technically, the patch works fine. When the toggle is flipped on the sequence runs through its notes and repeats itself. The submitter crafted a simple melody that is pleasant to listen to, even on repeat. The one suggestion I might put forth is that they should work to increase the length of the melody, add a different progression.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is very clean and looks really good. It's nice just watching the little lights go up and down while it plays. Sounds nice to, I can tell what song it is and its soothing, like a lullaby. The sequencer has two sets to play each part and they work well together. Only thing missing is comments.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The work consists of notes being payed while buttons are pressed, both maxpatch buttons and piano keys, to illustrate which note the song is playing currently. I am guessing from the title the song is Somebody but i admittedly do not recognize it. A toggle initializes the metronome, sending bangs, through a counter, which runs a select and plays different notes of the song. An additional patch runs the physical notes via the midi piano. I enjoyed this patch because it plays something fun that was easy to listen to and was clear what the author was trying to accomplish. In the future, I would suggest adding an element that would make the experience more interactive, like buttons that would light up on the keys so that the user could play the song rather than the computer.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Toggle turns on metronome that splits into two separate 24 channels sequencers. The two pianos are hooked back into one speaker with track being activated by toggle switch. Easy to use and clear presentations is effective and understandable. Basic looped track. Straight forward piano song with two parts, bang buttons and notes are arranged in a pattern that is visually appealing. Not the most interesting song but well done considering the effort to create it. Next time maybe choose a song that is more catchy?",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Patch was clean and very simple. It was pretty much bare minimum and I would've liked to hear a little more of the song but the part that did play was recognizable and didn't hit any snags. Also, would've like some comments.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is pretty simple and very easy to understand. The layout is good and flows from top to bottom. The jingle bell song was very recognizable and easy to hear. It reminded me of the upcoming holiday. inserting some pauses and longer notes in some spots could really make the flow of the song better.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks ordinary, but does what it is supposed to do. It plays the first part of the song Jingle Bells. The presentation could have been better, maybe using a sub patch to hide all of the wiring and adding a panel or buttons, but maybe the creator doesn't know how to do those things. Other than that it is a very well made patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like how simple/clean the patch is. I thought it would play a little more of the song so It kind of felt incomplete, not in a bad way, more like I just wanted to hear more. (i know we weren't required to do complete songs)",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is a simple, 16-step sequencer programmed to play part of the ""Jingle Bells"" tune. It works exactly how the example patch we created in class works, with a toggle object operating a metronome object which, through a counter object, sends several different values into ""make a bleep"" and consequently the audio output. Conceptually, the patch is very simple, and seemingly designed only to display the skills we learned in class, although it is a basically pleasant tune with an innocent connotation. The inclusion of more bars of the song as well as the use of polyphony to create harmony might have made this patch more interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks pretty intense but I can understand everything that's going on. It looks like they combined last week's assignment with this week's which is really neat. A metronome sets off a 3 different sequencers in order. First the metronome sets off the sequencer for buttons that are linked to sound files that have drums, then bass, then synth. I'm not really sure how the restart and stop buttons work to be honest but they're pretty cool! I liked this a lot because of how the user could interact with it. I think that was a fun element that was added to the project and I had a lot of fun making my own song with the beats. The only suggestions I really have are to maybe make everything a little easier to read. It's a little cluttered, although with so many elements I'm not really sure if there is a way to make it clearer. Also, I noticed the bass could only be heard in the left speaker, I'm not sure if that was an aesthetic choice or not but I would suggest putting them in both speakers.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The work is a three-part sequencer designed to play a complex instrumental with drums and synth, and it includes a manual element. It works by using the metronome/counter to send signal to ""sfplay~"" objects and the ""make_a_bleep"" subpatch, the latter of which is triggered using the process we used for the ""good key bad key"" project. The author created a customizable instrumental loop, which is similar to what I tried to do, although this is a more creative and fun application. The only suggestion I have is a little ambiguous thanks to my limited knowledge of Max, but I think there might be some procedural way to counteract the awkward latency time that interrupts the even progression of the metronome.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really like the overall concept of this patch. The patch creates a synthesized beat using Drums, Synth and Bass. It also allows the user to have a solo part and interact with the beat. It looks like a complicated design to program but it is very easy to operate especially with the comments telling me what to press and what everything is. I really enjoyed how this project let me interact with it although It doesn't sound very good when I interact with it. Maybe next time, instead of allowing the user to solo on a piano you should allow them to add and remove beats by pressing different keys.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"At first, I was blown away with how many sounds there were in the folder. And once I opened the patch, it looked very intricate and complicated. Although there were some tempo/sound issues, it was a well completed song.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Initially I opened it and instantly noticed how complicated the patch looked. It looked very interesting. To use the patch, all you have to do is turn on the ezdacs, then turn on the toggle at the top. Once I started using it, I started to have a lot of fun with the sequenced tones and the added feature of being able to play your own tones along with the sequenced tones. The only suggestion I can think of is making it a little bit more organized and easier to use. I feel as if many of the ezdacs could have been combined to make the user only have to click one. Other than that, it was beautifully made and I enjoyed it a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Somehow, I could not get it to work on my machine. The audio and videos would not play. I looked at the folder and the patch seems really cool. The user interface in presentation mode looks great. Outside of presentation mode, I think that the plan is to have the sequencer open a series of videos and sounds.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The work is set to run only in presentation mode. At first glance, before in presentation mode you can see that it appears somewhat complex. More went into this than was requested by the assignment. It's difficult for me to understand exactly how this works but I can tell that sounds are activated which then activate different video files that stack upon one another to produce a full image. I really like what it produced but I would change the sample files to be more relative and flowing to the visual piece. The sounds aren't something I would personally want to hear repeatedly for very long.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Oh my god! Sooo cool! I'm not really sure if it was a sequencer thing but it was cool!! Now that I look at it closer, it does have a sequencer implemented into it however, most of it is primarily visual and video. The start button works as well as the random button, though it was kinda confusing why there were two buttons. The visual presentation was outstanding, however the musical part was not really a recognizable song, it was just a bunch of beats and rhythmic drums. However, the music suited the visual. It almost made me feel like I was creating the music as I move my cursor around. The work might be improved by creating a song element to the presentation. Maybe have different sounds associate with different videos. Really cool visuals!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"First off, I could not get to presentation mode without opening it through MAX, not MAX Runtime, and the window was huge, I could not minimize the bottom to see the buttons so I just clicked around until I got it (but those are minor details). Once in presentation mode and pressing the start button, I was fascinated to see the face and wings and more faces pop up to different sounds. I was interested in seeing how the coding was done, since it is so much more advanced than the simple make a bleep, so I unlocked the patch and...wow. Now I see why it took so long to download. The sounds are looped based on the part of the totem pole (I guess is what it is?) and a video plays a small animation that correlates to the sound. There was the option to start from the top down, or to go in a random order where the sound would play and the corresponding video animation along with it. I found it to be an awesome interactive animation that I could see be on a website and a user would just scroll over a part and the sound would play and the specific part would animate. I don't know what else to say about improving it, I think it is well made.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I can tell that you spent a lot of time on this patch and it looks great. But I just couldn't figure out how to get it working. I got everything to show up except the videos. Maybe its because I'm using a PC?,,,,,,,,,,,
,"When first opening the patch, it shows one button attached to three sub-patches. I really enjoy the simplistic look. As for technical analysis, I did in fact have to go into one of the sub patches and turn on the audio which was kind of a hassle considering that I didn't know how to do that at first. The song itself is simple and feels familiar even though its a song I had never heard before. The different note length really added to the overall effect of this. My suggestion would be to solidify the audio issue. Maybe having an audio button right above the initiating button just for the purpose of turning on the audio would help.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Description:
 
 ""Untitled 2040"" presents itself like a music box: a small, simple exterior concealing its complex and illusive inner workings. There is only one instruction, ""JUST PRESS THE BUTTON!!!"", and after doing so the viewer is presented with a simple and soft yet haunting melody. 
 
 
 
 Technical Analysis:
 
 On the top level, a button is pressed sending a bang to three sub-patches ""short notes"", ""long notes"" and ""longgggg note"". Each sub patch receives the bang to toggle the metronome and then begin a timed sequence through 53 steps. If a note is to be played, than the ""select"" function leads to a note number, which is sent to the ""make a bleep"" sub patch. There are 3 note lengths, 500, 1000 and 2000 ms. After the sequencer has completed, if there are no more inputs from the user, it loops.
 
 
 
 Conceptual analysis:
 
 I used the term ""illusive"" intentionally. At the beginning you are only presented with a really simple interface that betrays just enough of its inner workings to entice the user into imagining the clockwork structures that lie beneath the surface. But, if you try to pinpoint the exact location of the music, instead you get to see only hints of notes, disjointed between 3 sub patches. Breaking apart the work even further using the ""make a bleep"" patches contributes to it's overall ghostly feel. In the end, hearing the simple sine wave generators teases a person who tries to pick it apart. It's deceptively simple- yet it's hard to picture in the minds eye just how each cog in the machine rotates. 
 
 
 
 Improvement:
 
 If and only if the author is going for true simplicity would I suggest that this could be arranged differently. Sure, the author could combine each of the sub patches into one patch with only one metro and one select that lead to three sine wave generators- and doing so might make it easier for the user to know what's going on in the patch. But it would also ruin the experience a bit. Here, the illusion of simplicity adds to it an ethereal quality that would be lost if actual simplicity was achieved. Only after digging through all of the sub patches does the user understand the true meaning of the piece, and it's only instruction- like a pointillism, scrutinizing and dissecting this piece doesn't lead the viewer to more meaning, to view it you ""JUST PRESS THE BUTTON!!!"".",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The project first opens up a small window with a button connected to 3 different sequencers (short, long, and longgggg) which play at the same time to produce the melody connected to the make_a_bleep patch. There are clear comments about the sequences and what she intended with the blank spaces.
 
 
 
 To make it easier to navigate there are four windows (the play button connecting the sequences, short, long and longgggg notes). She used an inlet to connect. It was a little redundant that she put in a button between the metro and counter, when she could just connect the metro directly to the counter. It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when she could direct connect them, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.
 
 
 
 I was confused at first seeing only the initial small window open. It did not play when I pressed the button. Only until I figured out to click the messages and turned on the sound in the sequencers, did it start playing. (Sorry for reading your comments last. Oops.) I had first played each of the sequencers by itself and then realized they were suppose to be played at the same time. It is very cute and pleasing to listen to. I really like the melody.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"At first glance, the patch looks very simple, and it plays a nice melody. Things are packaged nicely into subpatches, according to note duration. The main patcher window has one button which, when pressed, toggles the subpatches to create the melody. The concept was very nice and enjoyable. Being standard MIDI notes, it does begin to grate on your ears after a few times through. Right offhand, I can't think of anything that would have made it better.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"There is nothing interesting about the patch itself, but I was excited to hear the song since I am familiar with ""Funky Town"". But honestly, even though I had the songs melody in my head before I played the patch, I had trouble recognizing it when the patch played. There are pauses in the actual song that were not in the patch. It would have been much more recognizable if the pauses had been incorporated. The patch worked flawlessly. Adding the pauses would be the only thing I'd suggest.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This sequencer was easy to understand and very enjoyable to listen to. The sequencer is activated through the button objects, which played the tune of funky town. The design of the sequencer was familiar, yet still held original characteristics in functionality. I would suggest to add more background notes by adding another sequencer branch for the music to feel more ""whole"" in composition.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"One toggle, one metronome, one counter, ten buttons, ten notes, a beep and a speaker. Works well and fulfills the basic requirements of this project. Also uses well known tune that is easily recognizable. This is truly a basic sequencer in the utmost sense of the word, this concept could really have used additional development. Either a longer loop, additional parts, graphics or even a volume control could have added additional dimensions that would have taken this piece to the next level. Slightly disappointed that there was not more to it. Maybe this person is struggling with the program or musical composition is not their thing. Hope to see something a little more developed in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch meets all the expectations for the assignment. The organization is clear, although there is no commenting. It runs exactly as the in-class demo did: toggle, to metronome, to counter set with 1 and 10 as parameters, to the selector with the parameters identified explicitly, to the numerical values assigned each numeric parameter, to a number box reporting which line of the parameters is active, to the sound generator subpatch, and finally to the speaker. As far as feel, it was sort of lackluster. It was the minimum required for the assignment and nothing more. This is nitpicky, but I would have sped up the metronome tempo to match the song.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Initially the patch looks great, it looks like it is a pretty simple concept but still has a very cool technical look to it. It also worked perfectly upon trying it out. It was neat and the jingle it played was pretty cool. The only thing that you could have done that might have been cool is throw in the synthesizer keyboard for added visual effect.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really like this layout, it's nicely organized into four different sections. The midi track, and then three ""make a bleep"" sounds running under their own separate counters. 
 
 
 
 This patch works by turning it on with the toggle, which triggers the wav file that contains the drum beat, and the three bleep pieces that offer melody to the beat. 
 
 
 
 I think it's awesome that you went beyond having a patch that only contains ""bleeps,"" and actually incorporated a bet into it. This made the whole thing feel much more authentic, and just overall more musical. It kind of sounded like old video game midi sounds with a drum beat under it!
 
 
 
 I'm not totally sure if the wav file is perfectly in time with the bleep sounds, but it doesn't sound too off.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"By toggling the button, the patch begins an avant-garde sounding song with a percussion track. Each select option connected to several different keys, which made the whole thing sound spacey and cleverly ambient. There was also a wav file that played along with the rest of them. I really enjoyed the cool song that it played. That being said, I'm not sure it sounds exactly how the author intended. One select option had 5 beats, which contrasted with the 8 beat selector on one and the 7 beat selector on the other. If intentional, it was a cool effect! I would suggest possibly stating on the description the kind of sound you wanted to portray instead of just saying it may not work (confidence is key)! Also, the drum track continued playing even after toggling it off. Overall though, it worked very well!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I felt like it could have been the background music for an old nintendo game, I liked that. I would have cleaned up/organized the patch a little more but overall it was good.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch was well organized, I could tell what was going on. It works perfectly fine. It didn't really make me feel anything, it just made me think of aliens. I would improve this patch by adding one more note to each sound. It sounds like it's one note too short.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Opens a window with a large toggle button that triggers three sequences and a wav rhythm to go along it. (There is a random button floating in the third sequence. Haha.) It goes to the make_a_bleep patch to play.
 
 
 
 It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter. It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody. The open SongforMaxPatch.wav is opened twice in the sequence by the big toggle and the first sequence pattern (redundant).
 
 
 
 It seems to just be a random rhythm sequence, but it's fun and interesting to listen to. I was initially confused when I stopped it from playing and I still heard a rhythm. The wav file could have been shorter, so when the toggle is off, the music will stop more immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well done in completing the assignment requirements. You've definitely nailed the objective of the challenge in understanding how to use objects like metro in combination with messages, bangs, and select in combination to emulate the Harry Potter theme. Perhaps it is because of the instrument used or some slightly irregular timing, but it's a little difficult to discern that this is the Harry Potter theme. How did you transcribe the midi notes - using the sheet music like we discussed in class? 
 
 
 
 For the scope of the class assignment this project was done well and the patch was relatively orderly. It did not take me long to figure out how the patch worked and how to operate that, but this is coming from someone with some prior max experience. It may help in the future to label your toggle at the very least so we know how to activate the music right off the bat instead of searching for the start mechanism. 
 
 
 
 I love Harry Potter so kudos to the effort! I wonder how you decided to address your challenges in your own words in order to get to the desired solution.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When you first open it its a bit over whelming, all the cords and things.
 
 I don't watch harry potter much so it kind of just sounded like random sounds towards the end it almost sounded like it came from an old horror movie. but it works well and thats what counts",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Right off the bat I really love how everything is laid out. With so many notes everything can easily get very cluttered, but this makes it really easy to understand. The patch works by having a metronome set off a 37 numbered sequencer. The sequencer then sets off different notes. For chords the sequencer sets off multiple notes at once. I loved the Harry Potter theme song!!! Great song choice. That made me really happy and I think they did an amazing song dealing with all the different types of notes and chords involved. I don't really think there's much they should do to improve it. The patch itself is very clean and the song is recognizable; I think they met all the requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks really complicated because of so many connections everywhere. However, after closer examination, it was a relatively simple patch that incorporated all the techniques that we learned in class. The patch worked fine, it played the tune it was supposed to and it actually sounded like the Harry Potter theme. The sound was nice however, it did seem a bit choppy at times. The notes seemed a little disjointed but it still worked fine. Maybe, if the notes flowed together more it would sound like the real song from the movie. It sounded more like a computer made it than an actual instrument. It was still good though!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch itself looks very complex due to the song being long and has many keys. That being said I really enjoy the this patch. It looks like you put a lot of effort into this and I like how keys are similar to the actual Harry Potter theme song. Harry Potter is so iconic world wide that anyone who knows Harry Potter will recognize this song. You might want to clean up the patch a bit but overall it is a cool patch, I would like to create something like this myself. Great job!",,,,,,,,,,,
,Very simple patch that works.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Opens up a simple sequence and has the user presses the toggle to play ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."" Connects to p make_a_bleep.
 
 
 
 It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter. It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.
 
 
 
 It was interesting that the sequence connects several of the select bang points to single points (each time to sequence/melody hits F#, the point is connected to a single 66). While this isn't as easy to see the rests or the individual points when the melody hits F#, it makes it more condensed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Description:
 
 This patch plays the tune ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"".
 
 
 
 Technical Analysis: 
 
 When a bang is received, it begins a metro counting every 500 ms. The counter then cycles through all 32 steps in the sequence. If a note is to be played, the select function sends a bang to a message containing the note value to the ""make a bleep"" patch which produces the sine wave.
 
 
 
 Conceptual Analysis:
 
 ""Untitled 2055"" is successful in meeting all of the requirements of the assignment. The tune it produces is recognizable and everything works as described. It is the ultimate expression of utility and adequacy. 
 
 
 
 Suggestion:
 
 The only thing that I would suggest is getting rid of the number that's connected to the metro object. The number selects the time in-between each count by the metro, but the metro object already has ""500"" as the time. So, unless the author wanted the user to change the tempo of the piece, the number can be removed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"You did it! The patch works, it's neat, and it's obviously Mary Had a Little Lamb. By all accounts you've completed the assignment parameters nicely. 
 
 
 
 If you were to go above and beyond I wonder what you may have challenged yourself to do. I would also add a comment to the toggle box out of curtesy to let a new user of your patch know more directly how to activate it. Overall, well done in completing the assignment. Now to see where your creativity comes in when given more time or a more interesting project...",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your sequencer was clean and seemed to worked well. I feel like your sequencer worked well considering the level of work it took to make it. I feel like you made successful easy sequencer (nothing wrong with that) that worked correctly. One suggestion would be to go a little out of the box considering this was one of the examples he showed. But overall, good work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This one was a little bit confusing to me because I couldn't hear what part of Smells Like Teen Spirit this was from, but you did a good job and used a lot of notes. Also the instructions were very clear.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Upon opening the patch, there was a pleasant setup to the patch layout. Little text boxes helped guide the user through which buttons do what. When I clicked the main button. I was only able to hear about two of the bleeps, but I know there were more because of how many buttons and channels there were, so I assume there was a minor issue with the patches functionality. All in all, this patch does what it's intended to do and has a clean and aesthetic look to it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think your layout is very interesting, I also really appreciate the fact you have multiple things going on at the same time. The only issue I had was actually getting the melody to play! Good stuff though, me not being able to make it play was either an error on my part or could probably be remedied with a little troubleshooting.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Excellent job! Your patch is fairly clean looking, and you were successful in doing what you tried to do. Using the select on the 64th count to trigger the next part was clever and I have learned by looking at how you designed your your patch. The one thing that you could do to improve your patch is to add your own colors to personalize it that much more.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch plays two different parts of Nirvana's teen spirit using two different sequencers. Although it isn't the neatest looking patch, it seems functional and accomplishes the goal fairly well. The most impressive technical part is the use of counters in switching back and forth between the two different parts. I felt intrigued by the technicality though couldn't relate with the musical choice but enjoyed it nonetheless. I think this could be improved by organizing everything a little more and also fixing the overlap between the two sections.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I feel like you completed a basic sequencer. You used random keys just to create the ""song"". It is very clean and looks pleasing. I feel like you could have went a little out of the box and actually tried to recreate or make a real song but this was cool too. One suggestion would be to try to explore a little more than just the basic sequencer.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"After listening to your patch, I can say that you definitely achieved your goal making an aggressive irritating noise. But after a while of listening to it, it started to become like a trance and the notes made sense. It was a unique blend of different keys that made this patch enjoyable to listen to. The layout of the patch was clean and worked like it was supposed to. Good job.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch loks like another take on playing the piano via a metronome such as was taught in class. What makes this interesting and technically different is the addition of the saw~ tool which antialiases the music giving it a darker electronic feel to the classic piano notes. It creates an aspect of darkness and terror, like something in an electronica haunted house. I am not as much a fan of the particular sound, but I think it does a very good job of using one extra tool to accomplish a very different goal. The comments for explanation also helped. My suggestion would be to set the volume initially low and allow others to ramp it up because it blasted out my speakers on accident the first time I used it, although this was partially my fault for keeping the speakers up too high for the last patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch sends a metro to a subpatch containing two small sequencers attached to MIDI outputs and back out to an sfplay~. The sounds are cacophonous and a little grating, but not in a way that hurts the ears. It's irritating but not painful. Spot on with the stated intention. 
 
 
 
 As for how it might be improved, it'd be nice to use comments over messages. The message boxes attached to nothing cause some cognitive dissonance.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The work opened in two different windows and looked pretty organized. There was a few comments to help navigate the program, I found that helpful. I read the description and saw it would be irritating which I was not very happy with but it was still a very solid piece. I love the setup and the help it provides, I just dislike the sound itself.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The look of the patch is pretty clean, and easy to figure out what was going on in each step. Since the patch is simple, making the patch work was pretty simple as well since all you had to do was click on the toggle switch. The song that was played was ""Happy Birthday"" and one part of the sequencer played the melody and the other played a simple chord like beat. A pretty neat little idea to make the song have more depth. I really can't think of any criticism to give since it was pretty straight forward and easy to see what was going on.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"First off, the work looks clean and cohesive without looking too complicated. Technically, the patch works really nicely with no known errors. The author created a simple piece of music, namely the happy birthday theme, and it made me feel good due to how well made it it. Overall, I don't have much to say in terms of feedback as it's overall good.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch plays Happy Birthday but not just the melody! It looks like there are accompanying chords but unfortunately all you hear is a bass line. This adds a lot but it unfortunate because you can see that the intent is to play chords. I enjoy how there are two different sequencers happening at once. The idea is simple and so I didn't feel much other than just seeing the nuts and bolts of the patch. My suggestion would be to have three 'make a bleeps' instead of trying to play each note of the triad through one.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sequencer does play a recognizable tune of Happy Birthday. It achieves this by the use of many selects hooked to numbers for bleeps. The overall concept was there, but because the timing system was rigid to only having beats in time with the single metronome some of the bleeps were out of time for the song. The note timing could be changed by implementing a delay object between the select and the message for the note. By doing this, you could ""hold"" the bang for however long you want, only sending the message after the specified amount of time.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks great, I can see that the creator has made both a melody and a harmony. The patch worked fine, except I think that there were supposed to be some chords in the harmony, but there was only one speaker and the creator didn't wire it so that all three sounds in the chords could play at the same time so only one of the three notes came through. Still, I'm glad that they had both the melody and the harmony instead of just the melody like the other patches I've looked at. Just fix the issue with the chords. Maybe add two more speakers so that all three notes can play at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks like what we discussed in class when learning how to build sequencers. There are two metronomes that trigger the piano sounds to run, each playing in different octaves than the other and at different speeds. After hearing it for more than 20 times being looped, it begins to get redundant and kind of bothersome. Maybe because they aren't playing in a specific key and don't really have any melody. I would work on creating a melody if you ever build a sequencer again.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Based off of the description for this project, it was clear to me that this patch was built to play a sequence of notes that make up a melody. There is no possible way for me to misunderstand what the author is trying to accomplish.
 
 
 
 The way that this patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the top toggle. The toggle then activates the two multicolored buttons and two metro objects which then activate the counters, which range from 1-24 on each side. The counters are attached to two different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1-24, which are attached to different colored buttons. The buttons then are attached to a hidden and background checkbox, which can be selected to hide the buttons. These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a numbered message attached to each input. The number is attached to each input, and is then attached to a number object, which shows what number it received. This object is then attached to a makenote object and a noteout object that plays different notes based off of the individual number message it receives, it makes a sound. 
 
 
 
 The author managed to create a simple sequencer that played random notes that made up a melody. The multicolored buttons served as a good visual feedback and was considerably different than the original sequencer we learned about. Also the checkboxes that hid the buttons that were attached to the inputs for the select objects was also something that I thought was very interesting.
 
 
 
 My only concrete suggestion would be to possibly omit the number object that is directly attached to the metro object. I feel as though it does not really serve a purpose being there.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think that the overall of your patch looks really great, but the sequence of the note is quite simple. I think you should make it more complicate like a music note. The adjustable on your project is the strongest point because I can adjust the appearance of the button, the blink color, the outliner color, and the playing speed, however to make it better, you may need to add more creativity to it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I like the design of the patch it is colorful and without it It just another confusing patch. I like that you did not create a song but instead create something random. I also like that you created two sets to play at the same time. This patch could be better if you were to clean it up. Overall good job I like that you did it random.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch was pretty big, filled to the brim with notes and selects and was quite colorful. The patch works just as it's supposed to with no problems to be found. I think what may help with the patch is to put the instruction as a comment in the patch, other than that, it's not bad at all.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When I initially opened the patch, it looked very simple but once I clicked on the sub patch, I saw that it wasn't so simple. I really liked the idea to keep it condensed and basic because the creator of the patch also gives the user the freedom to make there own tones and tempo. The actual technical was pretty intense once you go into the sub patch, there were a lot of different sounds and numbers involved. Conceptually, it was pretty fun, nothing to crazy or advanced. However, I did enjoy playing around with the patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Absolutely beautiful! The design is flawless, I love the simplicity of the main patch, it was easy to use and understand. It was a treat to click on the subpatch and see the inner workings of it. It was visually beautiful and looks like it was done with great care. I felt totally in awe of the work. If only the sounds it produced matched the visual beauty of the subpatch, but that could be a tall order considering the beauty! What sound? Maybe a harp;)",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The first patch that opens just has the toggle to play the sound, I really like that design and you don't even have to look at the counter that is playing sound. The music is great too, it is recognizable and classic, the only thing I wish that was different would be the breaks. Because this tune is so well known when I heard it without rests it took me out of the song for a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The organization is very good. The use of subpatch makes it alot easier to look at. As for the overall product playing the key jingle sounded very nice. Good work on the sequencer I laughed a little when I heard the jingle. Maybe one way to improve would be putting in a message so that the user can change up the notes to create his or her own melody.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think that the overall of your patch looks really awesome, I love the way that you paint your button (Black - White - Black), it's so simple, but elegant, regardless I think that your project will look so much better if you combine your main patch and your sub patch together, so the user can see how beautiful your entire project is with out clicking at the sub patch. The sequence of the note is beautiful. I found that you have two modes to play the song, the auto play,and the manual play mode. However I discovered that it will be more interesting if you combine those two together. What I mean is that when you play the music automatically, you also control it yourself in the same time. The result will be incredible because you can add more dynamic, and diversity to the repetitive sequence.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch was simple and worked perfectly. I loved the theme and the colors used. The patch offered comments to guide me through the process, I found this very helpful. I think if it was aligned a bit better it would look cleaner, but thats just being picky.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your work is very well composed, follow the theme that we learned in class with the buttons, it's easy to read and understand. The colors and use of presentation mode give it a cool look and very pleasing aesthetic. The patch works great once you turn the speaker on, playing a version of the mario them song. The only thing I would suggest is creating a separate metro with a different time setting so not all the notes would be in a 4/4 pattern, this way it would sound just like the real thing.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When in patching mode, it was very clean and easy to see what was going on, and the usage of color was really nice. When you go into presentation mode, you got a little light show when you clicked on the toggle switch. When I played it, I smiled and was hit with a wave of nostalgia since it was the Mario theme from world 1-1. The sequencer itself is pretty simple and not too complicated, and runs fine when the switch was clicked on. In presentation mode, each note is represented by a color and that color matches in the patch flow. I can think of nothing to really improve what was already created since it was nicely done and well executed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The first thing that I notice about the patch is that the color incorporated really gets your attention and engages you to want to interact with the patch. I also like the actually simpliestic written instruction of play and sound on that are brightly colored. The functionally is great, you can tell that you pushed yourself by doing a higher number sequence and trying to challenge yourself to create a song that is recognizable. The simplicity of operating it is very easy, which makes the user interaction fun and non-intimidating. The creation of the Super Mario brothers theme song was a flash back to the past and I brought me back to my childhood video games. I thought you did a good job and that the song was recognizable. The only potential recommend will probably come as the skill set grows in the calls. I know it is definitely creating longer pauses in-between notes to make the song that much more recognizable.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sounds for this project are all correct when it comes to the Mario theme song, but honestly, either the tempo is off or there needs to be more spaces and stuff for pauses that actually happen in the song. Technical-wise, there is nothing wrong with this project. It has lots of number values that all show up and a lot of connections to things that are everywhere but I have no problem with it as long as your patch works. You created the Mario Theme Song w/o rhythm, basically, which isn't bad. I enjoyed it, but I currently just played this out loud in a lab and all these people in here were like ""oh my god, is that the Mario theme?""",,,,,,,,,,,
,The file is unable to be downloaded.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Unfortunately, I cannot download the max patch. When I click on download it takes me to a screen full of code. The visual element sounded really neat though!",,,,,,,,,,,
,Couldn't open it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,I don't know how to open this since it was uploaded as a text file. Please zip the work next time.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I was initially overwhelmed by the patch when I first opened it due to the 4 long rows of keyboards with connections resembling tangled ropes. However, after actually playing the patch, I realized it was far less complicated than it seemed to be and actually left me feeling a bit UNDERwhelmed. Basically the patch plays the same note 17 times at a metro rate of 200 and then starts over again. Honestly I thought it was kind of boring and I thought he/she could have at least used more than one note to give it some kind of melodic/song-like qualities. I'm still not sure how a patch can look so intricate and complicated and turn out to be this simple.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I love your layout very clean and easy to figure out. Unfortunately I was not able to find your Sf Play button. I am sad to not be able to hear your sequencer because Im assuming you applied music theory to make you melody happen.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"At first glance, the patch is organized very well, but it still seems confusing as to what is going on and what the user is supposed to do. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to program the sequencer to play what I wanted, or if there was a default loop that was to be played. The patch works using a metro object that outputs bangs to various kslider objects to receive output. I would improve this by making it more clear what the user is supposed to accomplish.",,,,,,,,,,,
,When I first opened this patch I expected a lot more. A very solid patch and works perfectly (I think). I wasn't certain if if there was more to the patch or if the extra keyboards just served as graphic entertainment. I would improve by adding comments.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It's pretty massive, and I had to zoom way out to see everything that was going on. It looks like it was replicating the same sound over six visual keyboards. It did operate simple enough since all I had to do was click on the switch, and the paths were easy enough to see what was going to what. I had to read the description to know what I was supposed to hear other wise I wouldn't have a clue since the visual keyboards didn't convey what keys were being hit. Maybe adding that visual part so that the view can see what the notes are would be something that can be improved. Other than it, the patch was simple to understand in terms of flow, and usability.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The Zelda sequencer worked through a metro which sent bangs to a counter. The counter then sent incrementing numbers to a select which then passed a bang out the corresponding output every time a correct number was passed to it. The bangs from the select then sent a note message to the make a bleep sub patch. It seems from listening to the melody as though the velocity or duration of the notes varies, some notes seem to ring longer than others while all being attached to the same metro. I think I would enjoy this patch more if it used the midi notes instead of the bleep sounds.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I initially turned on your patch with no idea how it would sound because I'm not a fan of Zelda at all. I never liked the game so I already have bias. When I turned on your patch, it was a melody of sorts that I think I remember hearing while I played it, which is a good thing. It's got a lot of number values when it comes to technicality, and you offer help to any user who decides to play your patch. It makes me laugh inside my head, because I am currently in the DC Lab but I enjoyed the simple patch that you had.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Opens up a simple sequence and has the user presses the toggle to play ""Zelda's Lullaby."" Connects to p make_a_bleep.
 
 
 
 It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter. It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.
 
 
 
 It was interesting that the sequence connects several of the select bang points to single points (each time to sequence/melody hits B, the point is connected to a single 83). While this isn't as easy to see the rests or the individual points when the melody hits B as a string, it makes it more condensed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks fairly simple with a few things standing out. There are a lot of good notes written about how the patch works! It plays Zelda's Lullaby. I feel like this was a good choice. This sequencer is pretty simple and only plays one line at a time however, you can change the speed of the sequencer which I hadn't seen till now. This is a really cool addition. I felt reminiscent of the old days while using this patch. I enjoyed it because of the association with my childhood memories. My overall suggestion would be to add another musical line to accompany the melody using another sequencer and to make sure that when using a very recognizable song that it plays the same. The notes are in fact right but I think some of the rhythms/rests are a little funky. This is a small thing but I feel like it would make it that much better!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is an attempt to replicate Zelda's Lullaby, from The Legend of Zelda. The system is easy to understand based on its layout, although its not entirely easy to figure out which counts don't output notes. It follows the simple sequencer structure of using a metro to count and selecting notes based on the count; there isn't anything surprisingly unique about this patch technically. The music actually sounds pretty close to the original song, which makes me remember playing the Legend of Zelda games when I was a child. The author could try adding in more notes to replicate the entire song, or some background notes.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Simply, this project is too complex for me to understand. I am not able to get it to play any sounds, so I am not sure as to what is going on. Pressing buttons seems to make things happen yet no sounds come out. Technically, this patch seems beyond what we have learned. I cannot comment more on this as it is currently. I would suggest making it simpler for someone like myself, with little Max experience and no music experience, to be able to make the patch work as intended.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks...well, far beyond the scope of this assignment. I have no idea how this was put together, and frankly I can't see that someone without extensive prior experience with Max could either. I'm sorry, but that's the extent of my technical analysis. I will say, however, from a user standpoint it is far from intuitive. This is the kind of machine that requires training to use effectively. It took me five minutes to figure out why it wasn't making sound. The volume slider did nothing until it was almost maxed out. I'm still not sure what all the various toggles were for. I played around with this for quite a while, but I can't bring myself to think that I'm any closer to understanding it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch was a customized 8 beat sequencer/sampler that allows the user to make their own sequences. It included a killer Donna Summers tune as a demo as well. Complete with beat counters and tempo control, this patch is an advanced and very clever piece of work. There were several meters and toggles that controlled volume and whether or not the sound would play. It also included its own keyboard for the user to compose their 8 beat masterpiece. My favorite touch was the title and how the ""III"" had the colors behind it that corresponded with the different sections of the patch. Overall, I was amazed by the work put into this patch and how well it turned out. I am not sure if I could offer a single improvement, it's great! I hope to learn a lot of the technology used in this patch in the future!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well, i do have to say this patch does look great both in presentation mode and out of it. The patch is a little complex for my knowledge but works well and does seem useful if you did want to make a little more complex song. Not sure how exactly it works but it does. The variety of the sounds and all the levels is awesome. This made me feel like there is so much to max that can and will be useful. To my knowledge I'm not sure how this could improve.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Right off the bat I could tell this patch a lot of thought put into it. It a colorful, yet simplistic and organized interface that was fairly simple to use. I was glad the author designed a presentation mode interface, because I think if I were faced with the raw patch I would have been utterly confused. That said, a few parts of the raw patch(non presentation) were a bit disorganized, but I think that might be because they were the visual components. The patch was an elaborate 16 beat sequencer that played a series of notes defined by the user by clicking and unclicking boxes. I was a bit confused on how to work the patch at first, but eventually I figured it out, maybe a little blurb about directions in the future? In addition, to that suggestion, when opening and playing the patch, I couldn't hear the sounds being played until increasing the volume almost all the way to the top/right of the slider. This was misleading because the volume appeared to be half-way up.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The striking red outline of all the components is the first thing that catches my eye upon opening the patch; it sets the mood quite well for the song that is being played. The sequencers have been arranged side by side with all the connections twisting about each other as they go into the message boxes. The metronome command and toggle play both, producing the easily recognizable melody from the grand composition. It is a stirring composition, and hearing it in bleep/bloop format is quite interesting, as if it was an NES game that the track had been taken from. My only suggestion of improvement would be playing with the piano note synthesizer to put it into classical format.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is a two-part sequencer designed to play a song with polyphony. It uses the methods taught in class, with two ""make a bleep"" objects for polyphony/harmony. The author creatively interpreted sheet music according to Max methods to try and represent a performance of a popular song, and the result is fun to play with. In the description, the author expresses confusion as to how to represent eighth notes, which could have been achieved with relative ease by adding more steps to the counter (and consequently the sequencer), increasing the metronome tempo, and adding rests. Moreover, a few added steps/rests at the end of the sequence would have matched the represented tune to a full bar of the song. In general, this project is successful.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really enjoyed this work, it was simple to understand as soon as I opened it, the colors were please to the eye and I knew exactly where to go first. As soon as I hit the toggle I was able to recognize the song. I liked how you did one metro in half time to even up the chords along with the lead part. Overall very good representation of this piece through ""bleeps!""",,,,,,,,,,,
,The overall look of this sequencer is very similar to the ones we did in class although there is another component which acts as a left hand and a right hand. I like the song it makes me happy and is something I can listen to on repeat cause its fun. The song is well done and flows smoothly. I think it needs more creative components to it such as visuals or something the user can interact with to make it more fun but over all it was good work.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"A really cool song! I liked how the left hand and the right hand were different tempos. The patch is really simple to use, all you have to do is click a button. After listening to the song for about a minute, I felt relaxed. I liked the set up of the patch because it looks a lot like mine.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Toggle connected to two metronomes, one set at half speed to the other. Splits into 18 and 30 channels of notes, left hand playing chords and right hand playing melody. Well crafted and nice use of chords, simple design, effective. I like the tune, it has an interesting melody. Concept is basic but well done. May have been interesting to show speaker or additional hidden elements to create a more interesting visual appearance. Volume controls could have also been added to isolate the different parts.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch has a fairly simple layout; there is a main toggle that activates the ""right hand"" and ""left hand."" I don't know if it's just how I'm hearing it after a few times through, but it seems to get a little out of sync as it goes on. I enjoy the concept, and it sounds nice overall. Maybe with a little more time, the note duration and synchronizing could be perfected.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Upon opening the patch I can see that it's very well laid out and clean as to give the viewer an understanding of how everything in ran and what it's being connected to. The set up to the patch it pretty straight forward in terms of the technical aspect of it. There are two parts, one for the left hand, and the other for the right hand. There are two separate tempo meters to give it a more of a feel that a pianist is playing the song. It's all done by a click of the switch, and the smoothing tones of the Jontron theme are playing. It's also fairly accurate too. I can think of nothing that the creator can do better on since everything was laid out and everything made sense.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It was a well designed patch, and it sounded very much like the song provided.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your patch is nice and consolidated, but I found it slightly confusing. I couldnt tell how the first two gates changed things. I enjoyed the music you made though. The comment boxes helped, though a few more that told me what did what could help.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I enjoyed the blending of samples and midi. I found it to be a pleasant melody in general, and how the patch worked was pretty easy to figure out. GIving the user the option to raise levels on the individual samples was pretty cool. Conceptually, you did a pretty good job of blending melody and rhythm into an interactive experience. My only suggestion would be to raise the bpm a wee bit.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like the interaction with the patch, how I was able to switch things and control the volume of the different sounds.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is a complicated sequencer designed to play different concordant sequences. It achieves this using switches and several sequencers designed using the in-class method. Conceptually, it achieves much of the beauty and spontaneity it intends to; I'm surprised to hear the different sounds. Still, the volume sliders are a bit unnecessary and erratic, as it's not immediately obvious why not all of the sounds are audible. Additionally, the patch could be improved with more sounds or greater complexity, such that clicking one of the switches would have an immediately obvious effect.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"So far this one takes the cake. The interface was easy to use and intuitive. There were a number of objects in this patch that I didn't recognize, but the signal flow looks essentially the same as what we saw in class. Since this was a dynamic sequencer rather than a song loop I'm not sure if I have the know-how to say with any certainty how this patch works. It was fun to mess around with, and ultimately generated some interesting sounds. I would have liked there to be more comments. There were some number boxes whose function was ambiguous, amongst other things and instructions would have helped.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When opening the patch, it was pretty big and had to scroll down to get the sound going. Technically, it worked well and didn't run into much problems upon starting the song. As the creator described, the song is original, but it is inspired by daft punk and it felt alright to use. A suggest I have to put down is to keep decrease the size of the make a bleep command and the sound toggle.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"So, a toggle sends a 1 to two different metros which then send bangs to three separate sets of counters/selects. The sounds are very spaceship-esque (very sci-fi), the track with the metro (set at just 3 miliseconds!) just starts sounding gnawing. I realize they were going for the three sounds to be together, but it just sounds droning. However, I do like the two other parts together. If I had done this one, I would have just used two metro/counter/select pairs, and just had one select output go to two different make_a_beeps. Also, I slowed down the metronome on the short one and the whole thing became more musically interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your patch was relatively neat and straightforward. The original creation was pleasing to listen to so well done with your creative freedom for this project. I hope your brain wasn't hurt too much in your previous efforts in changing the sound file. I wonder what you were trying to do in more technical terms so that perhaps in the future you could complete what you originally intended. 
 
 
 
 In any case, good job! You did the class assignment with some added creativity.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch has three sequencers in it rather than the usually expected two. The third one adds an extra element of sound by having all the tones continuously going off at the same time to produce a constant undertone. The other two cycle through an eight-note sequencer to produce a sci-fi like melody that plays on repeat. It sound great with the undertone going, but can feel rather stock/cliche after the first few times cycling through. My suggestion for improvement would be either experimenting with tempo or adding in effects that can alter/distort the individual notes in a manner that the sound can change and keep pleasing listeners.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looked similar to what I originally wanted to do, which was cool. I can't imagine how long it took them to develop that funky song. The overall layout of the patch was nice, it wasn't too organized but that is also a personal preference, On a technical note, the patch functions just right, all the numbers that relate to the make a note sub patch are really awesome and well thought out. Conceptually, I had a lot of fun playing with this patch and listening to the music that they created. I honestly enjoyed the strange Star Trek, Power Ranger-y song.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I enjoyed that the sequencer was exactly what was asked for; simple. I also liked the use of midi notes. I also ran into the issue of not being able to do multiple ""hands"" well. So again, I have other versions of my patch, but I still submitted what was the most simplistic to ensure it would work correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch has a nice layout and they didn't choose to have the sound come from a second patch. By routing the select to the same notes they didn't need to repeat the sounds in the beginning, but they did repeat notes later in the song. It worked as planned.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The design of the sequencer reflected that of what was constructed in class, which is perfectly fine. The sequencer was activated through the button object, which played the tune of Fur Elise. Overall, a good attempt at creating a sequencer. The music was enjoyable to listen to and the design of the sequencer was familiar enough that did not leave me confused or overwhelmed. The creator of the sequencer had trouble with additions to the notes, which can be attributed to the lack of time available in constructing our sequencers. If the user had more time, his/her work could have been more complete. Therefore, the only suggestion I could make was the addition of a sequencer branch to make the composition sound more fuller. Overall, nice job!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I liked the overall layout of the patch, it didn't feel to clustered or jam-packed. Technical speaking, I also enjoyed the patch. There were somethings in the patch that I didn't even know were possible with MAX. For example, how they just connected the first two numbers four times into the select object, thus creating the repetition in the first part. The overall conceptual idea of the patch was pretty simple but how they pulled it off made the patch truly enjoyable for the user.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch takes the piano and plays the beginning of Beethoven's 5. The author does a similar job of hooking up a metronome, select command, although changes and runs the Piano in a slightly different way in the code than previous authors did. I like the feeling of quaintness of the patch and it made me feel classical with the music selection. The author could have added saw~ or extra buttons to make the experience different or more interactive.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is a very complex sequencer hidden behind a giant button playing ""Comptine d'Un Autre Ã‰tÃ©- Die fabelhafte Welt der AmÃ©lie."" I understand the flow of it for the most part, but I get a little lost in it since it is complex. I wish I could offer more critique.
 
 
 
 It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter. It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.
 
 
 
 This is amazing. I love it. I'm saving it for future reference because this is too cool. It was very user friendly with the large button. I didn't realize how much would be hiding behind it. Great work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is a simple button that plays a song, with bass and melody. It seems complex yet is presented in an easy-to-use way. Technically, the patch works just as a normal sequencer, using a metro to play the base and another metro to control the melody. There are many more metros and counters within each to control the timing of everything. The author created a nice-sounding song without using a complicated method, so I can still understand how it works with my basic Max knowledge. I would suggest making it easier to access the sub-patches for critique, and commenting the work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is a beautiful patch, that really could have done well with presentation mode. The interface was simple but interesting and I appreciated the few notes, as well as the organized subpatches. The sound had a lovely music box quality, and there was even layers of planning enough to have it come to a natural stop. Well done. I would have loved more comments in the subpatches, as I didn't catch exactly what was going on at first. Well done.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Upon opening the Patch, I was quite amazed for ow simple it looked at first. The patch works great despite how simple it looks, at the press of a single button it's all smooth sailing from here. The creator made a simple song of sorts and it felt amazing that something could look so simple play such a greatly composed song. I got nothing to say on technical feedback but I'm really satisfied with the patch despite the loud beep at the beginning.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The design is really great, the colors are pleasant and I could just stare at it for hours. The technical parts were hidden and didn't distract from the overall look. I love this patch, it makes me want to step up my game and try a little harder.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The song is nice, not sure what it was or if you made it, but good job. Its easy to follow with the top down structure. Including the piano as a visual aid is also a good idea. The song kind of made me feel like I was in a western saloon. A suggestion might be to maybe soften up some of the hard notes or maybe extend them to flow better.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is the first patch I've seen that doesn't use the 'make a bleep' sub patch and I felt like hearing the piano sound separated this one quite a bit from others. Also, multiple notes are being played a once which is very cool. This is the most impressive technical part. Using commas to keep all of the note numbers in one message box so that they will be played together. I felt joyful listening to the light carefree music and also watching the patch work efficiently. Maybe there is a way to condense all of the numbers so that it doesn't look as cluttered.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Upon opening the patch I was initially put off by the organization. There seemed to be numbers and connection strings everywhere and it overwhelmed me a little. However, after I pressed play I was really, really impressed with the composition he/she had created. I had never heard this piece before and although it was a pretty basic piano track, this person implemented the use of chords in addition to individual notes. I'm not sure I would even know how to do that myself yet, so I applaud the creator of this patch. I really don't think I would suggest doing anything differently except maybe organizing it in a way that is more user friendly - making it easier to comprehend the construction to really understand what exactly is going on.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch uses make a note. It works great and plays notes and chords. The sound produced is more like a real piano which was very nice to hear. It uses a counter, from 1 to 48, to sequence the notes to be played. It definitely made me sayWOW! It also shows that a lot of care and work went into the program. I am glad the connection chords are routed behind the note numbers, and I can see how this got very complicated. The only suggestion I could make would be to tame the spaghetti chords in the back, but that is a personal preference. In the old days, we called some codespaghetti code when the paths weren't clear. One way to do that would be to break up the work into multiple select statements working off of the same counter. That would break it up into more manageable pieces, or bars, and make it easier to maintain or modify. However that said, I know many artists who like the organic nature of exposed wires and find them beautiful.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"There's a ton of notes here making the appearance look somewhat messy, but it still follows the same design shown to us in class, and the key buttons to make it run smoothly are easily identifiable. 
 
 
 
 This patch goes starts with the toggle, goes through the metro,and then goes on to select the desired notes after counting through 48 beats. A midi key board is included at the bottom to give a visual representation of what notes are being selected. 
 
 
 
 I like that you chose a classical piece and included piano sounds over the bleep sounds. The piano sounds just add to the authenticity since you've chosen a classical piano piece in the first place.
 
 
 
 It works nicely, and sounds good. There's not much I can say to add due to the fact that this a piano piece, and you've constructed this patch to do exactly that, play the piano piece. Well done!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"It looked interesting enough to look at and i was looking forward to use it but the sound was not playing for me, i turned on the speakers in the program and i made sure all sound files were properly placed in the same folder as the project so it would work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Right off the bat this patch looks super interesting. I see three sound boxes so I immediately assume that whatever it will produce will be pretty elaborate. Upon 'dropping the beat' I was pretty impressed with what you created, it was cool to see how much you could really do with this assignment.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really enjoyed this patch, it was different and it mades me wish I tried harder. I didn't recognize some of the commands and I used the help to figure them out. I overall really liked what they did.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is a good patch and easy to follow based on the layout. The volume sliders made this patch enjoyable. being able to make the bass overpower the rest (as well as my computer speakers) was a bit of fun. Changing the volume was a nice touch. To improve you could add different types of imported bass, just as a little more variety.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The work is visually appealing and makes you want to engage with the patch. I really like that you pushed yourself even though you said you did not have the knowledge of music. Creating a counter up to 35 to incorporate the first two parts of Fur Elise was a way of definitely pushing yourself and that fact that it is clearly recognizable is great. I would have never known that you did not have a greater understanding of music by this patch. A simple toggle button engages the metro with a counter measure of 1-35, which feeds into your output to engage the specific keys to the Fur Elise song. I don't really know any suggestions that I could make because I think it is great peice. Maybe another layer could be adding color to the piece.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Great job is getting the assignment done and making a neat max patch. Considering you do not have a music training background your efforts to transcribe the song are commendable. The sequencer is easily recognizable as the beginning to Fur Elise. 
 
 
 
 If you were given more time I'm sure you'd practice the nuances of rests by placing in ""blank"" select slots with the proper metro designations, but this easily becomes complicated with a piece of Beethoven. 
 
 
 
 Well done!",,,,,,,,,,,
,I had to turn the sound on. But after that it worked. I enjoyed the lay out. I felt it was easy to follow and how the project was achieved. I could easily replicate. I feel this is an important feature of any project such as this; Can I see how you did what you did so I could make it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The sequencer was simple in design and easy to control. The song ""Fur Elise"" was played when the sequencer was activated through the button objects. Due to the lack of knowledge with music, the creator did mention that he received a majority of help through Youtube and was able to construct the sequencer to play the same tune. The sequencer was not complicated, which is great for those who get overwhelmed easily. The only suggestion I could make was to at least attempt to create a different song...maybe an original song in order to better understand music. It is difficult to understand music when you have had no prior experience with music composition, but time and practice can change that difficulty level to a simpler one. Overall, it was a good sequencer and song, but I would have liked to see more originality in the design and music design.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Very simple patch. I like the choice of music selection also.,,,,,,,,,,,
,First off this patch is way to big this does not fit my screen! You could of made the buttons a bit smaller. next is the colorful scheme which I enjoy it makes the patch more intriguing. The sound however is very subliminal. I feel like I am listening to some sort of art installation and all you are missing is a video display. Overall its a nice patch just needed to be a bit smaller no need for those excessively big buttons.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very technical appearance, with big pretty buttons all over the place and wires going in every direction. Still I don't feel it looks messy at all, since the toggle object stands tall in purple at the top of the patch.
 
 
 
 There seems to be many different metro-counter-select-make a bleep arrangements going on simultaneously with the wav files you have included with the ""sfplay.""
 
 
 
 You've obviously included some sort of message behind this piece, with the random ""life doesn't give a f**k's"" and robotic woman speaking over the bleep sounds. The message may be obscure, but with that comes a certain level of curiosity that makes this patch compelling. 
 
 
 
 I don't know if there's much to change here. The layout may be complex, but getting the patch to run is very simple and that's all that really matters.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Although confusing to work and hear, the patch was aesthetically pleasing. And the sounds seemed to mesh well together.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Awesome. First of all it looks great. Secondly your samples are creative and I find the cheerful bloopy almost childlike melody over the raw hard samples a nice contrast. One thing I would think be cool, although possibly contrary to your artistic image would be to have the melody and samples playing in time to create a more music scene overall.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"WOW, was definitely my first impression. The intricacies of the piece are incredible and the incorporation of the various size component and colors; green, yellow and red give it a level of initial visual intensity that is definitely engaging. Once you turn on the piece you realize the greater level of artistic flow. For me, this piece invoked a strong feeling angst, listen to the layering of the words takes me to the challenges I have faced in life when I felt someone how I was entitled to a better outcome. I really do not have any suggestions for improvement. This piece was very thought invoking, more so than any piece I have seen......great artistic expression!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch had be laughing so hard, it was done so well and it could almost replace 2Chainz in that song. It had a simple feel to it, with a normal toggle just like the example from class. The use of the ""open"" feature was cool because you were able to use samples to create a drum beat, sounding just like the real thing, and the vocal samples that you could include were just the icing on the cake. Love it!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch when I first opened it was pretty cool. I enjoyed that it wasn't just a basic looking Max patch but rather a fun bright patch. Just from looking at the patch, you can identify that the creator spent a good about of time on creating it. On a technical stand point, it functioned perfectly once I loaded the additional sounds on to my computer. The song was completely recognizable and was super fun to play around with. I enjoyed how to the creator made it fun to listen to and how it was easily recognizable. I really liked this patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very nice Patch 2Chainz! I can tell you are a fan of his music. I very much enjoy this piece, its very different from other patches. The beat is almost exactly like the song. Very cool and creative patch I really enjoy this. You could of change the button color scheme like gold and red but thats my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Toggle connected to two metronomes, one connected to melody while the other is playing drum sample. Additional buttons allow user to play additional samples. Interactive and includes graphics. Works well and fun to play with, clearly illustrated. This was my favorite as it combined samples and interactive graphic components. Simple but easy to use and shows musical talent based on compositional elements. Could have added other samples and made the loop longer. Maybe some additional graphics?",,,,,,,,,,,
,"There is a nice combination of color in this, purple and yellow, but the rest of the patch has been laid out in typical fashion, a good thing to do. The interesting aspect of this patch is the inclusion of the open command and sfplay~ command in loading vocal sound files in time with the notes being played on the other sequencer, and the command of being able to play sound files on command by pressing one of the two additional buttons included. While the technical aspects are very interesting I do not care much for the actual sound/music because I am not a fan of rap. I think that working the button commands into the sequencers by turning it into more of a sound mixing board where audio can be played on demand in a way that alters the flow of the track would be awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Super cool and very complicated code under a super clean presentation mode. There are four parts. The main part plays constantly at the default volume. The other three parts of the music are inaudible at first but are controlled by sliders that made this patch both interactive and fun to use. This was an extremely well thought out patch. I played with it for too long because now the tune is stuck in my head! 
 
 At first I couldn't get the fourth part to play, but this was a minor issue. I went back to the download file and there was a folder in a folder. In order to hear the fourth part I had to put all the sound bites from both folders onto my desktop. A small operation but well worth the effort, because the patch was so cool?",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very nice yet complicated visually. The patch was pretty complex visually but worked flawlessly. The instructions served to get me started and were much appreciated. The patch was organized neatly and was visually pleasing. I really enjoyed the melodies as well. The only thing is maybe one comment to tell me exactly where the volume bars are, since I am a noob it took me a second or two to figure it out. Great patch!!! Thank you",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is so nice. Firstly, I thought it was very interesting that the author decided to use sound files to play each note instead of using the MIDI messages to trigger an instrument. Regardless, the program turned out wonderfully. I liked the presentation mode and how each beat triggered a ""light"" which was really just a button. The program runs by using a metro object that sends bangs to various messages that contain MIDI number values. It seems as if the author correlated the number values with .aif files of each of the notes she/he needed. I would suggest that it may have more functionality to use a midi instrument since that would give the sequencer more usability in a music setting. Regardless, it is a wonderful program.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch has three main blocks of components, all pretty large. The left-most part was actually cut off and had to be moved so I could see all of the parts, which could have just been an issue with my screen resolution being smaller than the one in which the patch was made. It seems pretty intricate, though, and probably took a lot of work to get right. It works by pressing the large square button that has a few ""press to start"" messages surrounding it, which triggers three different metronomes to start and play beats through counters and select objects. I really enjoyed this patch. I've always been a (very) casual LoZ fan, and very much enjoyed all of the music/songs that are part of the games. The song sounded really nice, very calming and serene. To improve the work, my main suggestion would be to better organize the patch. All of the metronomes had the same interval, so only one was really needed, and one ""make a bleep"" probably would have been enough, however I didn't mess with it much to see if there were multiple copies for a reason.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I enjoyed seeing the songs people picked to play. The noise of the synth matches the tonality of the video game. So I enjoyed that link. (Pun intended) 
 
 I felt it was cumbersome in parts, or the spacing of the notes was off. 
 
 However, overall, this was a very good project.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch sequences the song starting with a single toggle which is hooked to three identical metros. From there each metro is hooked to a counter with the arguments 1 48. Then through three selects the patch sends note numbers to make a bleep objects. I'm not completely familiar with the tune, but it felt as though there were some awkwardly long pauses in the melody. Also this patch could have been achieved with 2 fewer metros and counters. Rather than make identical objects, consider making a single master time keeper, and then use send and receive to pass the information to different sections of the patch. Overall it would be cleaner and perform better as the complexity of works increases.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Initially I opened it partially expecting what I would get out of the patch in the end. As if the title didn't give it away. it looked pretty good when I opened it, maybe it could have been organized better, but that is just my opinion. There were also good comments to help the user touch what they should, and not touch what they shouldn't. When I started the patch, my suspicions were verified. It was indeed the song of storms. It made me feel good. I especially enjoyed the fact that I could change the speed of it. Overall, It was wonderful. The only suggestions I can make are to set bounds on adjustable number objects. Other than that, Awesome job! Legend of Zelda is awesome!",,,,,,,,,,,
,Great and simple sequencer. Polyphonic and great choice in music. I don't know how it can be improved upon. I'm just enjoying the song as I write this review.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Sonically, this is the most interesting piece so far, as it uses more than just the built-in MIDI tones. The patch looks a little busy, but with everything that was included, it has to be. The whole process is activated with a single toggle, which runs various subpatches playing the notes. The description given for the concept is a little confusing, but I like the outcome. I think this may have worked out better if I understood the goal of the author, so maybe just making things a little more clear.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks kinda complicated since it has many objects we didn't learn about. The sound of the patch was nice to listen to and sounded very futuristic. I liked it very much because it had a ""whoosh"" sound at the end and I thought it was cool and wondered how to make that. The patch worked correctly, it played a song over and over again. There were symbols at the top of the patch that I wasn't quite sure what they did at first but then I understood that they were two parts of the song and that it combined them together. I thought it was really neat way of doing that. Maybe for improvement make the patch a little less cleaner, ti seems very spread out.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks a bit complex, yet the buttons used to control the patch are simple. It seems to work through subpatches with their own metros and counters that cause notes to play. There are two different 'songs' that are playing, which can both be triggered off and on. Technically it seems that it works well but could have been organized better. Conceptually, the patch feels unique yet not something that I personally find interesting or nice to listen to. I believe someone more interested in music would find this patch to be interesting. I suggest making the patch more organized or commenting with the purpose for various things.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch was clean and slightly complex at the same time which is good. The song piece, which was an original I'm guessing, was pretty cool. I was a little confused by the number options (0, 1, -1, 0) because they didn't do anything as far as I could tell. Overall it was a pretty clean and cool patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Super dope little loop you got there. The interface was very simple to understand and use. I like the reversed beat hit and the neat melody including bass tones. I can actually listen to the loop for a while. My only suggestion would be perhaps accentuating the simplicity of the patch's function by bringing it into presentation mode and making the interface even simpler.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The organization of the patch could be a little better but overal you did a very good job. I enjoyed the sounds it brought me to a feeling of happiness. Maybe adding a filter would go a long way with this patch.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This, as soon as I opened it was very interesting and cool. I like how you explained everything that went into the design of the patch. And the actual song that played was very good and well put together. I'm actually interested how you did quite a few things.. All in all the sequencer turned out sick and I think you've got this one down.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The complexity of the piece is extremely impressive. This is far beyond anything I could fathom creating in max. the intricacies of the piece are incredible and the incorporation of the 560 individual notes was outstanding. The fact that you spent the extra time trying to understand the programming aspect and simplifying the patch by adding the simple text file line by line made for a much easier user experience. I also felt like you were trying to educate the user by adding the text boxes. I really appreciate this, because it gave clarity to parts of your patch that were over my head. Once you turn on the piece you realize the greater level of artistic flow. I really do not have any suggestions for improvement. It might be fun to add a greater visual component by adding more color to the piece.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is very well organized for how intense it is. This is a really cool sequencer that plays Bach's Solfeggieto in numeric values. There are several text files that call the numbers because there are so many which makes the patch very organized. I am amazed that you had the time for this. The song is fantastic and seems really complicated and time consuming to go through all the sheet music, unless you put it through a translator. The only thing I think would be really cool is if you made some visual components with it so it looked cool as well as sounded really cool. Overall, Good job!",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch looks decently clean and simple for the complexity it involves. My issue was that I wasn't for whatever reason able to hear anything. The patch does include comments which are nice and seems to stray from the example made in class which is good because it shows other ways of achieving things. I just wish I could've heard it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The visual was very colorful i enjoyed looking at it. The melody was excellent and i enjoy classical music as well. I believe this person did the job and did it right.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is colorful and pleasing to the eye, simple and easy connections. The music plays when the toggle is switched on and the same set of eight notes plays twice before one (or two) of the notes change higher or lower by a single note. The process is repeated for the different colors and is a continuous loop. I really like how the color changes for the buttons as their sound plays so that I knew exactly where I was. I was excited and tried to guess which note would change next in the sequence and try to figure out if more than one changed. For improvement I think it would be neat to add an accompaniment.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Looks simple and easy to use. The colors add some fun to the project and I like how the chords change.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch looks very nice, with the colors adding more interest instead of just the regular grey. It works really well. I like how you figured out how to change the notes without making it look confusing. I feel like a lot of work was put into this even though it isn't complicated. Some of the other ones I've seen just look like the minimum. My only suggestion would be to find a way to make it interesting, but hide the actual patch work, as if it were an actual app that was being marketed. You wouldn't want the people who bought it to see all that wiring. Other than that, great job!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This colorful and all-around pleasing patch was a pleasure to see! The toggle turns on a cute song that after 2 bars goes into 8 beats of a similar sequence of the same melody. I honestly am not quite sure about how some of the things in it worked-but that's a compliment! It seems like a great next step to the simple sequencer assignment, so good job taking it to the next level! There were different counters involved, so I assume that is how the song went to the different sections. I really enjoyed the feel throughout the project! It was very fun and seemed like something that could be a children's game (I mean that in a good way). I don't know if I could add an improvement other than making sure that you upload your file in the .zip format, it was a great project!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is simple with visual buttons to see the sequence as it plays along with the additional numbers at the bottom that correspond to the keys of the keyboard. It works by hitting the toggle and the sequence plays through and keeps looping until you turn it off. I did not personally know the tune of Onett (before looking it up!) but it sounded nice and concise, made me happy. I suggest cleaning up the keyboard numbers a bit. Instead of on hookup to each number, there can be additional connections to the same note, they will just be played at a different time, depending on where the connection is in the sequence.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch was very similar to the tutorial, the only differences I could see were that it used a 16 counter instead of an 8 counter and had some rests/breaks. That said, the tune it played was pretty. I had never heard of the intended song or the game it was from, at least not until I did some googling and realized it was actually part of the ""Mother"" series. This amused me because I follow a few people on tumblr who are utterly obsessed with the games so I know a bit about it. Anyway, that has nothing to do with the actual patch, but it did improve my overall experience because I was able to connect it to my own life. I did notice that there was both a ""make a bleep"" and a ""bleep"" subpatch, and only the ""bleep"" one was needed, as I was able to delete the former(and it's connections) without the patch being broken.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch has a tree branch set up, with the individual buttons stemming from the counter function. This patch did a good job of keeping a clean and professional look. Functionality wise this patch is exemplary. There were no technical issues playing the sequencer and it even had a nice little melody to it. Great patch.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Simple and easy to understand. Very similar to what was shown in class. The patch is neat and works.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch runs a simple metro/count/selector that apparently plays the Onett theme from Earthbound, though it's hard to recognize without varying note lengths. There's also an unused make_a_beep subpatch. It's simple and technically proficient. I would work on creating variable note lengths.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Toggle, Color, one metronome, notes, four parts, shifting chords, this does it all! Obvious in depth understanding of the project and creative and interesting development of the work. Well organized and explained, this piece is user friendly and easy on the eyes and ears. Hard to complain about this one, maybe could lead to a longer composition otherwise its bloody fantastic!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"As a huge fan of horror movies, I was excited to hear this patch because the word ""eerie"" was in the title. Upon opening the patch I loved the fact that she used color for the buttons, giving it some aesthetic appeal. I really enjoyed the composition, and it didn't disappoint. It was indeed eerie - something that you'd hear straight out of a paranormal movie. The composition also included more than two notes playing at the same time which went beyond the bare minimum requirements. The combination of individual notes and chords really helped to give it that creepy repetitive feel, and there isn't anything that I would have changed about it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like the overall look of this patch. It's easy to navigate and understand what I'm supposed to do to make it function properly. I like how you got different chords to be struck using the metronome. The different colors are helpful for me to see what notes are being activated throughout the melody. You composed a piece of music that is tranquil and not terrible to listen to over and over in any way, that's impressive considering you say you are not a musician or composer. I feel like I'm learning more about Max just watching the buttons light up. I'd suggest composing a longer melody.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Description:
 
 When activated, this patch plays a tune that is the author's original composition. The author makes expert use of polyphony in their work.
 
 
 
 Technical analysis:
 
 When pressed, a toggle sends a bang to a metro that counts every 300 ms. From there, a counter measures every eight counts. If a note is to be played, a message containing the note value is sent to the ""make a bleep"" sub patch, and then a sine wave is generated. 
 
 
 
 Conceptual analysis:
 
 The piece is actually 4 times longer than I originally thought! It counts through 8 beats four times, not just the same 8 beats. The author is making a very good use of alternating selects and counts in the signal flow- meaning you can divide the piece into beats and measures by having a count that leads to a select that leads to another count that leads to another select. The fact that the first two chords that the piece produces are very similar sounding creates a surprise moment when the last to measures sound completely different. Although the author says in the submission that they are not a musician or composer, I think this piece shows the author has a clear understanding about the technical/ mathematical structure that music and programming have in common. Also, the use of color in max patches is never bad- and at firs glance it looked like the author was simply placing colored buttons at random, they actually match the pitch of the note, which is a great way to convey to the user what is being activated when a sound is played.
 
 
 
 Improvement:
 
 The only improvement that I can see with the patch is to take a look at the select object at the furthest left. The comment pointing to it suggests that there is a rest on the 8th beat, but the 8th beat is actually not a rest, a note is played. Other than that there is nothing of a technical nature wrong with the patch. One thing that the author should do, however, is be more confident in this work! There is no need to lower expectations by suggesting in the submission that you're not a composer because you've created a wonderful composition here. And in the patch there is a comment saying ""I attempt a chord.."", but in reality the author succeeded in creating that chord! This is a great work and the author should be proud of it- there is no need to be timid about this effort.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch looked well organized and presentable. I thought the sound was decent and could tell there was a nice amount of effort put in it. I was recommend dolling it up a little more next time.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your idea and concept are very simple, but the sounds that are chosen are funny to me for some odd reason. It sounds like the George Lopez theme song without the trumpets and if it was slowed down a bit. I think the actual idea of how you wanted to present this is different from what a lot of other people decided to do and the sound is a little bit low on this DC Lab computer for some reason, but it's still a good patch. Everything with the technical analysis is fine, even though your sound is coming out without one of those buttons to stop and play sounds, which I didn't expect.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When they described that they had the ""least amount of musical talent"", I thought hey I can't be that bad. The patch looks very nicely displayed and is concise. It shows the notes playing on a piano and acts as a nice visual. The patch worked perfectly, it played all the notes in the right order and repeated the sequence. It didn't really sound like a recognizable song but it could easily be turned into a new creation. I thought it was also funny how the person wrote Warning, I have no musical talent. Don't worry, it worked fine and I thought it was nice and simple tune.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is great. There is a lot going on and it sounds great. The layout is cool and they used commands that I wasn't familiar with. If anything they could organize the patch a little differently, but overall I really liked what they did.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This piece is very simple, and just plays a short repetitive tune. The work is activated with a single toggle, then plays through its various other components. It's a simple concept, and didn't really spark any specific feelings. I think this work may have come out a little better with a bit more effort, and a longer melody.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch plays a simple melody on a loop. That is just the beginning though, because there are some really cool objects in it. Plot~ and Picslider objects added some fun to looking at and playing with this patch. The picslider made the patch interactive, because you could click and drag the button and that would change the sound. I loved the Plot~ because it bounced to the music and was visually appealing. The patch is super cool but the electronic sound and short repetition wasn't too pleasant to listen to.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is easy to understand and produces a simple melody. It uses multiple bleeps and two counters to create a simple 8-note melody. Technically, the patch uses things that are not necessary, such as showing numbers multiple times and using + operators instead of a message of the specific number that was desired. The 'select' has 3.14 and 10, which are never received from the counter. The second counter goes backwards yet never hits 1, 3.14, or 8, as the select has in it. While it doesn't affect the way the patch works, removing those things would make it easier to understand. Conceptually, the patch seems like it demonstrates knowledge of how a sequencer works yet doesn't create sounds that are great to hear. I would suggest removing unnecessary elements and trying to make the bleeps into a basic recognizable song.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very nice. It is clean looking, sounding and works right out of the box. I also like your creative use of more complex objects. Harmonically it sounds great. One thing though is that with how well and neat your patch is I bet you could have had more amorphous interesting melody.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"First of all, it took me a second to realize you sent more than the actual project required. I got a max patch for four things, which is going above and beyond but it's totally cool. For the max patch I think I am supposed to critique, it was simple and intricate. There were no visual or technical problems with how your project worked. I just want to know why you sent the ""make a bleep"" patch and the other two. Still, your patch is very intricate and simple, which is a good thing. It made me feel anger because I thought I was going to have to critique four different patches, but at the end of the day, I'm very chill. My only suggestion is to not have a folder of work, only what is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This was a cool little melody. However, the last four notes don't play for some reason. Besides that, great job! Maybe try adding in chords or using rests!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I like your work. Not too hard but not too easy. I don't know if you know but the last five buttons aren't connected so no sound is made. It was very clean and basic and I feel like you successfully made a sequencer. One suggestion would be to go a little out of your comfort zone and try something a little harder than a few keys. But overall, good work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well done! This looks like it was a bit complex to set up, but it works like a charm. Everything is labeled, your layout is fantastic, and its fully interactive. I dont feel like I have anything I could suggest to you to make it better than it already is. I told someone else this, but If you had gone throw and changed the colors of everything that might have been cool.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"A little overwhelming to look at upon first glance but I love the idea. There are three sound files that play according to which gate the user decides to open. Each sound represents a drum sound which are clearly labeled on the sides. There is also a clear set of instructions that allows for ease of use. It works when a gate is switched on and the beat repeats but can be changed accordingly based on what gate the user opens or leaves closed. The author created a neat basis of beats that could be easily changed up from a simple click. It was fun, trying to think I had a good sense of rhythm but it was definitely exciting to jam out to after. For an improvement I think it would be neat to add a few more sounds even though it was totally awesome with just three.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"At first glance I said ""oh Sh&* but It was interesting. Im not sure if I did it correctly but It seemed like a lot of work for the minimal sounds I actually heard. But it did work correctly and it was pretty cool. It took some time to change the sounds to make it unique but it works great and is pretty interesting. One suggestion is possibly trying something to randomly change which sounds go where to add to the variety of choices. Great work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Great attempt at a Roland Tr-909! This patch sequences three types of drum sounds. It uses gates as a user interface to turn on or off a sound within the sequence. A master volume slider and levelmeters objects made it easier to use. This is a very successful patch and is super fun to play with. I have played with it on two separate days. Both times I had trouble making sure all the sound files were available for the patch to use. There was file inside a file and once I loaded all the sounds from both files and the patch to the desktop the patch worked flawlessly. Even with the directions it took a while to get it to work. This would be a great one for presentation mode because it would visually simplify the user interface.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch plays a blues tune using a two-part sequencer, with each part moving at a different speed and containing a different number of steps. Everything visually looks like what we did in class, but for some reason I'm having trouble manipulating it correctly such that I can hear both sequences instead of only the 64-step one; I played with the patch quite a bit but couldn't figure out what was wrong. I'm interested conceptually in the idea of representing a blues standard through Max, but I wish I was able to see the full effect. The author might improve the work by thoroughly testing the patch to avoid such issues, and perhaps by organizing it in a more visually accessible way (I had to scroll quite a bit horizontally before I could see what was going on).",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is really complicated and doesn't have to have so many elements that are on it. The buttons are not needed in your patch so it would have been easier for you to just connect the selectors to the messages directly. The patch is also very big and could have been shrunk down. If you were to use it again it would be really hard to copy. I really like the song I think it has a very interesting tempo with all the pauses but its suppose to be blues so I get why it's the way it is. I think your patch could also be more fun for the user if you were to change anything about it I would add some visual elements or some ways for the user to interact with it. Especially with blues music, a lot of it is improvised so you could add some other tones to it that the user could press to play.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"My initial reaction was that this patch was massive, not necessarily a bad thing though, it was evident it probably took a lot of tweaking to get right. There were a substantial amount of notes. The patch uses two different metronomes and a series of notes to create a blues song. The song sounded pretty cool, it was enjoyable to listen to and by the author's description I could tell it probably took a while to perfect. I did notice some unnecessary parts. The blank message boxes used to create rests/breaks weren't exactly needed, those select outputs could have just been left empty, which would have helped with the size of the patch as well. I think you would have done so if you knew though, as it probably would have saved you some extra work!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch is very big. The sequencer didn't fit the screen. However, it still retained the clean and functional look. When the sequencer is activated, a really jazzy melody begins to play. This patch did a great job utilizing the tools to make a cool melody.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Your patch huge width wise. The sounds kind of sounded like something from an old game which i liked. I don't know if its possible but I would suggest somehow making it so everything is visible on the screen or at least most of it at a time.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Overall of your patch looks great and complicated, The template that you picked is so catchy, however you might need to do more research on how to embed the URL link into Max. My suggestion to you is that you might add the cougar sound(like the original version) into your project by adding .wav file instead of playing just midi note. This will make your project so much more interesting in the way that you want. I believed that you put a lot of effort in to this work because your patch is well crafted, however there is a part that it seems not working to me, which is the """"Extra piece"" otherwise everything is awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I like the melody in this patch it has good pacing and nice soothing sound. I like the complexity of this patch and how well it is put together. This is a good patch overall and I like it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very very nice patch. This patch was very organized. The patch looked complicated but all I had to do is toggle it on and it worked flawlessly. The melody was amazing as was the entire work. I have nothing but praise for this work. If I was forced I would ask for graphics or visuals, but I didn't feel like I needed it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"So it looks like there's three different sequencers that make up different parts of the song. Everything is laid out very cleanly. I particularly like the left most one; it's actually really aesthetically pleasing to look at. I think this setup was a smart way of making sure all those notes didn't look too clustered. It works very simply, which I like. The metronome sets off three different sequencers, and that's basically it. It's very simple technically, although I'm sure it took a lot of skill to actually organize all of those notes together. I really liked the song created it was very pleasing to listen to. Also, I checked out the song (definitely putting that on my iPod) and I think they did a really good job of matching the song. I can't imagine doing that without actual sheet music or midi notes (major kudos!). The only suggestion I have for improving the work is that you could put in some synth sounds if you use the techniques we learned from the last assignment along with this. One of the other assignments I critiqued used a sequencer to set off sound files in a specific order to create a beat, so you could try and do that to achieve the same sound as the original song if you wanted.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I think this was supposed to be Surfin' USA. The patch was too big to fit in the Max window on my laptop. There wasn't a toggle so it just started playing as soon as it was opened. I'm not sure what the blue blinking dots were for, but I can appreciate trying to give the patch a little sprucing up.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Gotta love the Beach Boys! The Led visualization was a nice touch and the patch was simple enough to understand. Although, I feel like the tempo was a bit off.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch has an unusual structure to it in that much of the commands and objects are quite miniaturized and on the sides while these giant bright blue buttons, acting as a sensor that detects sound and lights up, are front-and-center. It's highly unusual, but a fun idea, especially given the upbeat tempo and message of the Beach Boys' music, before Pet Sounds, that is. The structure of the mechanics of the patch are very routine, there being an interval command, though, that slightly changes the tune every pass-through, which makes it interesting to listen to time-after-time. The Beach Boys are a classic staple of music, and Surfin' USA was and is the epitome of the surfing scene so I quite enjoy listening to it repeatedly. For improvement I suggest reorganizing the patch hierarchy to make the actual technical aspect more understandable.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch looked so crazy and complicated and I am astounded! The sound was very nice and creative and I would recommend it to a friend. I think they could have advanced a little more only because I see more to be accomplished.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This is my favorite patch so far. Although on the bigger side, this patch offers a visual accompaniment to the carefully thought out melody that the sequencer plays. The added visual aspect lets me get a better feel for the melody and is a great addition.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"After clicking download, the patch did not load as a typical patch would. Instead of showing the presentation, it went straight to the coding of it. I am not sure if this was because of my computer or because of the way it was saved. However, I can tell by the coding that work was indeed put into it! It's a shame that it didn't show up, I'm a huge fan of the song Earth Angel, and since the author is a pianist, I'm sure it was done very well! But since I wasn't able to see it, I can't say these things for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,
,It won't open correctly. Maybe before submitting assignment try to close and open it so see if it works. Im jsut getting a bunch of Hooplah.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Well despite your challenges you did the required work for the patch so that's good. It was very simple in its function and that is not a bad thing. I can clearly see you tried to make a somewhat discernible melody using this labyrinthine software. My only suggestion would be to practice with Max a bit more. It seems like foreign calligraphy right now but once it clicks with you how it works it will be much easier to use. That being said, Max will never stop being frustrating in general, as I have learned.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When I click ""Download"" I am taken to a page containing endless text computer script. I'm not sure why this is happening, as all 4 of the other patches I just critiqued downloaded fine without any problems. Not sure if this is a technical error or some kind of error made by the creator of this patch, but unfortunately I have nothing to critique. Here is a screen shot of what I am seeing: http://i62.tinypic.com/an1lbs.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Oh no! I can't see this one either, when I press download I get redirected to a block of code. Sorry, especially since you had to redo everything :(",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The Ramones are AWESOME! The sequencer very well designed and was not too complicated to understand, which left me feeling relieved from the other complicated designs I've critiqued. The tune was just as enjoyable as the sequencer and it did do justice towards the original song. The time it took to create the sequencer must have been awhile, which shows through the original composition of the sequencer. To be honest, I don't know what I could say to the author to improve his/her work on this project besides adding moving graphics. This is an introductory course yet others have shown to have more experience patching on the Max program. The author is clearly ahead of the game with the project and it ROCKS!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The notes seem to be all correct in accordance to the song, and the patch works quite well. The only thing is, maybe slow the tempo down a tiny bit.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Since you do have so many notes playing the side structure was a good idea. The button flashes directed and visually represented the song. The song is recognizable through the patch. I also commend you for attaching all the connections.,,,,,,,,,,,
,This patcher appeared more complicated than it really was. I liked the beat and it was very catchy. I could see how making it was a challenge but it was very entertaining. I have been recommending for everyone to make it colorful and stuff of that sort just to appeal to the eye more.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Really dug the melody and bass. I can see you took your time with this patch finding the right notes, which I know is a pain in the ass. Technically it was very simple. I had fun switching one part off and back on, changing the variation of both sequences playing together, and it worked. My only suggestion would be maybe incorporating midi and finding other sounds. Thats not really much of a suggestion, I'm just required to make a suggestion. I liked it!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch used the make a bleep with a grouping of selects, counters, and metros. What was unique for me about this patch, was the dual melodies that could be played either together or separately without there seeming to be something lacking. The author even enabled the user to quite easily hear each side separately or together. In the future it isn't necessary to make duplicate metros and counters, instead make a single master time system, and the use send and receives to move timing data to the selects. Then to make one side play and not the other, add gates between the receive and the select with a button hooked to the left inlet. With this setup you can hit the button to allow numbers to pass to the select, and you never have to worry about one side being out of sync with the other.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When I opened it, I was quite surprised at how massive it was, leading to how the creator put a lot of work into this. Technically, The lead part seems to work fine but I will say that the rhythm could barely be heard and had to listen closely to even hear it. The author created a song utilizing two seperate selects for rhythm and command, and it felt alright to use. I suggest to raise the volume on the rhythm section a little bit, but it's pretty good overall!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"As the description says, there is both a lead and rhythm section that the user can activate one or the other or both at the same time. Both pieces of music are enjoyable for listening on a loop and sound great together. It's nice to have the ability to play with the tempo of each by having the number object attached to the metronome. This allows the user to experience with different speeds to adjust how it sounds. I've had it playing in the background for about 10 minutes now and haven't gotten annoyed at all, good job.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Based off of the description that was written for this project, I was able to determine that this patch would have two different sections for a piece of music to be played, a lead part and a rhythm part. Both of these parts would be able to be played separately or collectively. The description ensures this by naming both sides and by saying that the users can do this on their own.
 
 
 
 The way that this patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the top toggle. The toggle then activates the two lower toggles, the two buttons and two metro objects which then activate the counters, which range from 1-32 on each side. The counters are attached to two different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1-32. These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a numbered message attached to each input. The number was attached to each input, is then attached to a number object, which shows what number it received. This object is then attached to a subpatch that plays different midi notes based off of the individual number message it receives, it makes a sound. Then, to toggle the sound on and off, there is an ezdac object attached to each side.
 
 
 
 The author created a simple song with the use of 2 different set of notes. Their sequencer branched out into two different sides, one representing the lead, the other representing the rhythm. By including toggles on both sides as well as a top toggle, it is possible to listen to these part together or to just the listen lead or to just the rhythm just as the description said would be possible. Going over this patch was very easy and convenient due to the separate toggles on each side and due to the labeling of what was the lead and the rhythm that was on each side.
 
 
 
 My only concrete suggestion is that I believe that it would be possible for the author to omit the number object that is attached to the metro objects on both sides. It does not really serve a purpose and when I was just trying it out to affect the patch, it turned the notes into a jumble of sounds, rather than a song.",,,,,,,,,,,
,The patch is very interesting to look at. It almost looks like a wreaking ball and acts as the visual element to the song it plays. It is also looks simple to create and not very complicated. I think the creator made a good choice to use the chorus of the song. It would have been interesting to hear the full song with the background music and all. The author created a computerized version of a popular song with both a visually appealing element and musically adept part.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"From first glance it looks really clean and seems to work correctly. It was a cool way to make the song and it was very easy to tell how it worked. You successfully made a song from a sequencer and that was the assignment so great work. One suggestion would be to add something to make some of the notes last longer to give the song some depth. But overall, great work.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This sequencer is very elaborate and looks very overwhelming at first. Though, upon clicking play I can see that other then changing tempo you really didn't do all to much extra stuff. It works nicely, I'm not very knowledgable of the actual song but I'm sure it sounds about like that. I think with the synthesizer piano visible in this, it could have been really cool to see the keys play the song.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Terrible song choice. You could've chosen a better song. Out of all the songs in the world, you chose wrecking ball by Miley Citrus? I must say I'm disappointed actually. This patch made me feel agitated, which is unfortunate since I was having a great day before listening to this song. Now my whole day is just going to go into a downward spiral from hear on out. It's stuck in my head now. Anyways, I think you did a good job with this. I like how you added pauses in the sequencer to match up how the actual song is. It was very easy to understand due to labeling. My suggestion would be to choose a better song.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"A single toggle runs to three metro/counter/select combinations, which each lead to a make_a_beep. The sound certainly has a spooky vibe to it, with sort of a eerie music box feel. The only change I would make would be to clean up the patch some - there's no need to have three separate metro/counter/selects if all the metros are the same.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Based solely off of the description that this project has, it is very clear on what the goal is, which is to make ""music"" using internal synthesizers. There was no possible way for me to misunderstand what the author was trying to accomplish.
 
 
 
 The way that this patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the top toggle. The toggle then activates the three metro objects and three buttons which then activate the counters, which range from 1-8 on all three sides. The counters are attached to three different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1-8, that are also attached to 8 buttons on each branch. These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a numbered message attached to each input. The number was attached to each input, is then attached to a number object, which shows what number it received. This object is then attached to a subpatch that plays different midi notes based off of the individual number message it receives, it makes a sound. Then, to toggle the sound on and off, there is an ezdac object attached to all three sides.
 
 
 
 The author successfully created a sequencer that played a tune that was inspired by the Halloween season. The way that notes were arranged really made it sound like it was a haunting tune. The three different branches that this patch had served as a way to make chords happen. The patch itself is really clean and I can hardly see any faults with it.
 
 
 
 My only concrete suggestion would be that if it's possible would you be able to possibly condense your three branches down to two by maybe placing the two numbered messages on a single input?",,,,,,,,,,,
,I love the simplicity of the design. It doesn't look over the top and does exactly what the assignment asked you to do. The patch uses a metro object to output numbers into a make a bleep object. The patch makes me feel that Max isn't something to be afraid of and that anyone could use it to make something useful or entertaining. I would suggest adding user input into the patch so that anyone could make their own loop.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Description:
 
 This piece produces a dissonant piece that reminds the viewer of the music from ""Nightmare Before Christmas"".
 
 
 
 Technical Analysis:
 
 When the user selects a toggle, the piece activates 3 separate metros which count in sections of 8 beats. If a note is to be played, a select sends a message containing the note value to the ""make a bleep"" sub patch which produces sine wave.
 
 
 
 Conceptual analysis:
 
 I don't know if this was intentional, but the way that the buttons blink with that intense yellow along with the music reminds me of the halloween decorations that have little blinking light for eyes. 
 
 Anyway, this patch does a very efficient job a creating a haunting piece of music for the user. It's really easy to see how everything is ordered, and how the patch works.
 
 
 
 Suggestion:
 
 This is just a wild and crazy thing, but I noticed that the whole point of the piece is creating a dissonant, creepy, tune- and the notes seem to group together. So, one suggestion might be that, instead of listing each individual message for the for the note, you could elevate this piece by connecting them to a random number generator instead. That way, not only does this piece become something that is new and exciting every time someone uses is, it plays to the strengths of using a computer to make music- like the fact that computers can generate their own note values.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This patch is really neat. The sequencer plays a very catchy song that is really popular now. They nailed the melody and it sounds exactly like the real song. They even added a vocal to make the sequencer more advanced. Overall this patch is very functional but also adds a fun side.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Visually and functionally this piece was very strong. This was the only piece that I saw that incorporated the mini key board, which gives it a heightened level visually. I also really liked that you incorporate notes and a voice over wave file creating the additional layers. Technically the piece is very intricate, with the two different counter sets 1-34, yet the simplification by the clean design make it easy for the user to follow, as well as engaging. Another element that I really like was the meter, it was a nice added visual component to the piece. I think you put a lot of time and effort into this work and it shows. One way to elevate it might be to create another metro box on the second counter layer and change the speed slightly to create a different effect. Great work!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"The patch is easy to read and understand, I like the use of the ""open"" function for the spoken word, and how the notes play only after the words have spoken. The timing is on point, and everything flows well together, overall I think this patch is very solid and the use of spoken word makes it interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"When I first heard this song I started laughing. Something about hearing a song like ""Talk Dirty To Me"" in a Max patch is just funny. The patch works as in was intended to do and the layout is clean. This was probably my favorite one out of the 5 I reviewed because it was hilarious! Good job.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Hah! Awesome job for completing the assignment with an easy to follow max patch and creative output. I appreciate incorporating another sample in time with your midi sequencer. I appreciate the integrated use of metro and counter and it really seems you've got the know-how to program a sequencer in Max. 
 
 
 
 If you had more time to factor in beat samples or create synthesizers I would be anxious to see what you come up with. Great patch!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"At first glance, it looked simple enough. I didn't know what a few of the objects were but once I started using it, I figured it all out. Other than that it was fairly straightforward. It has a nice melody to it so it made it feel relaxing. I didn't know what a few of the objects were in the bottom left, but they were really cool. Overall, I liked the simplicity of it with some cool objects. Great Job!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Very colorful.Nice patch, and it works.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Good job making a simple sequencer and adding the background for a nice effect. Maybe try adding in chords or using rests!,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch was a simple, yet very well done 10 note sequencer. It features two different meters to measure sound, which was very fun to see. It also had a background color changer to help make it seem customizable to the audience/user. Overall, the patch was a clear and precise way to sequence the music files, and the little spices added in made it a lot more fun. My only suggestion for an improvement would just be to possibly make a more recognizable melody for the sequence to play, but that's just being nitpicky. Other than that, it's great!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Patch was very easy to read, looks very similar to class example, although the colors and various meters added make it aesthetically pleasing. Over the patch ran but the sounds were a bit boring, but I enjoyed the customizable options you added. Maybe making the bleeps go to a certain song would make this patch a bit better.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Description:
 
 This piece plays a simple 8 note tune when activated.
 
 
 
 Technical Analysis:
 
 Then the user selects the toggle, it begins a metro with only 150 ms delay between beats. That activates a sub patch which contains a 1 to 8 counter. Then a select object sends a message containing the note value back to the main patch which generates a saw wave.
 
 
 
 Conceptual analysis:
 
 The inclusion of a saw rather than a sine wave, with its gritty, mechanical tone color, plays well with the fact that the notes in the tune seems really ""techno"" and ""computer-y"". 
 
 
 
 Suggestion:
 
 In Tinapple's ""make a bleep"" patch, he included a message and a line object with the sine wave object that decays the tone over the length of the note. That would be useful in this patch because when the metro is turned off, it continues to produce a tone. It's hard to tell if you were going to a specific tune or just random notes, but if it was just random, you could include a random number generator that would greatly expand the scope of the project.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Not much work appeared to be put into this patch. It played a little jingle but nothing to impressive. I would recommend playing around with the keys more and trying to have fun with it.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Very organized and easy to look at. The sound is pretty obnoxious but it has that deadmau5 electro ring to it. Very amusing. Maybe on eway to improve would be making it so that the user can choose what notes to be played in order to create a more personal melody.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"This piece is more abstract than others, due to use of a sawtooth oscillator. The work is activated by a toggle, then just goes through a simple sequencer like we went over in class, but is put through the oscillator just before final output. I like how it turned out, and it sort of reminded me of an old arcade game fight scene. Overall I thought it was good, but I wouldn't have minded if it were a slightly longer melody.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This patch built on the make a bleep setup, playing an 8 note loop. After the make a bleep section, a sawtooth wave generator was added to the patch. Unfortunately the saw~ made the sound a little bit abrasive and even after the toggle was off, I was getting sawtooth noise from the patch. In the future play around with the attributes of the object more rather than just dropping it into the patch. MSP has many synthesizer objects and all of them can do great things when you take the time to play with them.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This looks fantastic. If only It sounded as good. I think it is compelling how you set this up though because you can potentiall create melody, counter melody, harmony, and even triads. I was not able to get any audio out of it though. Also speaking from experience on 808/909 style step sequencers having a simple ""on-off"" versus a potentiometer style nob creates easier playability.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"So the patch looked cool when I opened it up. I don't often see more than the basic patch so I was excited to see one so different...until I couldn't figure out what to do. I turned it on and it beeped, the same note over and over again on three lines and I found that I could raise the volume, change the notes and make it go faster, but it didn't really follow the instructions. It was supposed to play a song, not leave the user to figure out how to make the song. In the end it just confused me. I would suggest at least giving some instructions on what exactly to do because even after playing around with it for a while, I couldn't really do anything with it. Still a cool design though.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Excellent layout. Perfect organization, nice colors, clear and big font, and nice volume bars and note selecting knobs placed throughout the patch. 
 
 
 
 The patch works by turning it ""on,"" which then begins a piano note going at a steady tempo. The tempe bar at the top controls the beats per minute, there are three sustain bars included each with their own volume bar, and three rows of sixteen knobs to control what notes are being played. 
 
 
 
 I absolutely love the fact that this is an interactive piece in which the user is improvising a piece of music right on the spot. It's genuinely fun to play around with and spend time tweaking to see what type of chord progression comes out of it all. 
 
 
 
 I have no advice to offer on how to improve this, you've made a wonderful patch. Though, if there was a way to select between different midi instruments, that'd make it even more awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I was stunning by the cool graphic in the presentation mode. I think that the overall of your patch looks really great, but the sequence of the note is quite simple. I think it would be great if make a default note sequence more like a musical sequence. The adjustable on your project is the strongest point. I believed that you put a lot of effort in to this work because your patch is well crafted, but it would be better if you can add more creativity to make it more vibrant.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Visually this is the best patch I have seen. It is very pleasing to the eye. Maybe one way to improve this would be to put in different keys so its not just the same note repeating over and over again.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The last couple sentences of your theory are worded confusingly. You should add more of the equations to the theory. Could do another study or two. In your conclusion I would talk more about the drag forces and motion than the code itself.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I would recommend getting a little deeper with your study and results, just by manipulating the factors in the drag equation and explaining the way the code behaves under these changes. There a few minor grammatical errors I noticed in the conclusion so I would go ahead and review that, but overall the report was easy to read and fairly well done.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations
 
 (a) All equations used in this project were properly described within the theory of the report.
 
 (b) Program runs correctly and displays numbers within the ranges of expected values.
 
 (c) Code runs, but is not explicitly verified within the body of the report. More emphasis could be placed on why the output makes sense for given input values.
 
 (d) Only the initial conditions chosen by the user were inputted into the code. Further calculations and results were not described within the report.
 
 
 
 2. Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study
 
 (a) The introduction clearly introduces the topic of the assignment and what concept this code is trying to convey. It is concise and short, but provides all necessary information for an uninformed reader to follow.
 
 (b) Since there was very little varying of parameters, the study possessed little depth and significance. The code runs correctly, but what does the output say about the study? About drag force?
 
 (c) No new information is given from further computations.
 
 (d) Conclusion vaguely covers scientific study, but does not go into detail.
 
 
 
 3. Quality of the report
 
 (a) The users English is sufficient, and the read runs very smoothly and effortlessly. Transitions are easy to distinguish and the topics flow together throughout the entire report.
 
 (b) Though I could reproduce the calculations shown, there are very little to warrant any great understanding from simply doing so.
 
 (c) The conclusion is somewhat vague, but conveys the major concepts and connects with the report.
 
 (d) The report looks professional. Graphs and tables are not simply thrown together, descriptions are placed in appropriate places, and sections flow from one to the next.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Technical Accuracy-Your report is very accurate and you do a good job of explaining applications of the project. I think you could add some other explanation to your theory though... maybe explain a little about the constants rho, A and C, what they mean and they affect the problem( just to add some depth to the theory part). 
 
 
 
 2. Insight and Depth- You did a good job in your study documenting different scenarios and how they would affect the problem. i like how you used a baseball as an example to help the reader visualize a real world example that can be related to. Your figures were well labeled.You might think about making them smaller though and writing explanations around them to make it look somewhat like a text book ( the way you did it isn't wrong its really just a personal preference thing).
 
 
 
 3. Your report read well and i think its overall appearance was very professional. you may want to change some ""Technical Phrasing"" they said we should write as if the reader doesn't know very much about dynamics.
 
 
 
 great job there really isnt much that you need to change to be ready for final submission",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Overall, I really like the presentation of the report. It is well organized and with the presentation of the report it makes it look very professional. 
 
 In the introduction, it is very thorough and gives good insight to what the project is all about. I like how you incorporated drag force into your project because it makes it unique and shows you actually know what your talking about in your report. Also, with the incorporation of including how engineers will/can use this in real world situations make it an interesting read.
 
 In the theory, I like how you defined all the variables you used in the report which makes it very clear on what is going on in the report. It is very easy to follow what is going on for the reader.
 
 In the study and results section, I like how you explain what each graph is displaying with and without drag. Also, having labeled the graphs correctly helps the reader understand the physics behind the report.
 
 In the conclusion, I feel you can expand a little as you can tie in the whole project and apply it to engineering.
 
 In the appendix, I ran the code and it works.
 
 Great report and keep up the good work!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your report is great! I would just tell you that you could use the word equation instead of pictures for your equations. Also, you should have submitted a pdf copy of your work and not the doc one. Great job.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"You had stellar code verification, however you might want to turn a case or two that you had in there into studies. You didn't have a study section at all you just said that the code works. There were a couple proofreading errors that you could fix also.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Your code is working and is verified in your report. Your report looks good and is fairly easy to read through. The only thing i would say is to label your equations differently. Your tables looks good with ""figure #"" underneath but you should label your equations with it on the side. It might just make it look nicer to read.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Nicely done! Was easy to read and very good construction,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Make sure you uploaded your project as a PDF and not a word document. Your theory and code verification was very well done however your study and results is where you should discuss the difference scenarios tested using the code, the results they yielded and the assumptions or conclusions made from these results.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Nice presentation of the report. Great idea on talking about the applications immediately in the paper. It draws the reader's attention and shows the relevance immediately on what the research is about. The presentation of equations 3, 4, and 5 is a little confusing, though. You don't explain exactly what or why the equation becomes an approximation. Also, equation 5 is not the result of adding equations 3 and 4. I'm not sure if that was the intention of that sentence, but it is a little misleading as far as that and how beta is involved. Under ""Study and Result"" explain the difference between the explicit and implicit versions of the code and why one may be more preferable over the other. Also, maybe delve a little more into what happens when changing parameter values. What happens to the motion? The prompt asks for a study of terminal velocity as well. See if you can manipulate the parameters to show how that occurs with this model you've created. Code is not complete, I am unable to run it and test it.",,,,,,,,,,,
,I like the report and all of its sections. I like how you tied in real world examples to show how the code could be useful in real world applications. one thing I would say to work on would be the study and results. it didn't seem like you did much for that and it could be added to and improved. other than that it was an excellent paper with a solid conclusion to bring it all together,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Fancy. Nice way of formatting, very unique. 
 
 I suggest wording a few sentences differently so it doesn't sound so repetitive. Your study and results section could definitely use more detail and information, include graphs and pictures of what your MATLAB code generated. 
 
 Overall good job.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Theory: Your theory is correct. Could not verify the code, seems like you didn't copy the entire code into the appendix.
 
 
 
 Interest and Insight: The report was extremely short, and a little redundant. I would add more info into the theory and the study.
 
 
 
 Quality: Again, just add a bit more depth to it, and it will be a pretty good report. Code verification is also needed.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"I really like the introduction and cover page! However your ""Study and Results"" could be elaborated a bit more (add graph, explained them, etc...). 
 
 
 
 Good job overall!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"This was a very nice report, very clear and easy to understand what the CP was about. Some minors things that could be changed are the sections make the section title bold just so it is easier to distinguish them. Also add some other trials to see what happens the projectile motion, maybe even add the wind!!",,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations
 
 Great introduction and theory. The conclusion is a little short.
 
 
 
 2. Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study
 
 The comparison from implicit to explicit code is a good study, consider adding in one or two more such as increasing the 'c' value, or adding wind to the code.
 
 
 
 3. Quality of the report
 
 The report is well written and easy to read.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Very Good work. you showed that you understood the problem and the study as well.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The Introduction to the report is missing some more introductory information about whats to be done. You can talk about the concept of drag acting on a body moving through a fluid and how its proportional to the velocity and opposite of the direction of motion. Also, you can explain a little about how Newtons Method is utilized in the project.
 
 The Theory Section of the report explains with great detail the equations and definitions of the forces that are being studied. All variables are explained in order to clear any doubts. Well explained, and stated too.
 
 The Study and Results section have good graphical analysis as well as explanation of the modifications and their outcomes. Each graph, including the Command Window, is explained in detail. The incorporation of Newtons Method in the code and project is also well stated and explained. I would try a few more modifications and either put the data and graphs in the report, or talk about the outcomes from these.
 
 The Conclusion was also well stated. The topics of the project were explained again. The results were explained as well as the incorporation of different densities and their outcomes. I would talk just a bit about the physical outcomes different densities, initial velocities, mass, etc. have on the trajectory of the projectile.
 
 Excellent report that could use some more modification and variation to the Study and Results section.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"At one point you say ""And, knowing the rules of derivation in dynamics, velocity and acceleration can be found known to be:"" and go on to give velocity and position equations.Your drag force equation, as written, is incorrectly twice throughout the paper. The 1/2 is in front and the rest of the variables should be in the numerator, not denominator. Near the end you seem to get into the idea of terminal velocity but don't elaborate on it. Discuss what it means, how it is achieved, and see if you can model it through your code. Does the code give you values consistent with the definition of terminal velocity. Try to do this by messing with the parameters of the drag force equation. At some point in your report, try to mention how this is relevant, outside of class, to real world engineering problems.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Good start but more evaluation in the Study & Results section, go into depth about the code's capacities other than what was already given. The code needs to be verified as well and a few grammar/spelling errors.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technical accuracy: 
 
 Theory and program are correct. However, the code is not verified. There should be a special part in the report for code verification. he computations are done in a good way, and they are easy to follow. 
 
 
 
 Interest and Insight:
 
 Study is not completely described in the study and result part. There should be more in depth and details in that part. 
 
 
 
 Quality of Report: 
 
 All the report parts are there, which is good. All of them look good except the study and result part, as I mentioned before. It needs more depth and details about the explicit and the implicit parts. I don't see any evidence for the study, although results are listed with some explanations. Also, if you add more details in the theory part, it will look even better. Conclusion connects to the goal of the project, and presentation style is good.",,,,,,,,,,,
,it is a very well written paper that gets right to the point. the only thing that I might change is the introduction a little. I like the background you provided but maybe getting to the point of the project right away and then explaining it to them. other than that like your study and how every thing is explained and well detailed great paper.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"introduction;
 
 Your introduction seems good and completed.
 
 
 
 Theory;
 
 in your theory, you provide most of the needed equations follow it by a good explanation as well as your study and result.
 
 
 
 conclusion;
 
 has good summarize of the whole report.
 
 
 
 Indeed, your report looks good, and just don't forget to add the implicit part",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Theory
 
 Have your equations on the own line, center them and add a caption
 
 overall good report",,,,,,,,,,,
,"1. Technical Accuracy-Intro looks good. you need to add some explanation to your theory (but i think you know that)
 
 2. Interest & Depth- you have your code working which is good. now you need to go a little more in depth with your study. EX. what happens when you change the drag coefficient? what happens if you change the mass? Could you add a cross wind? These are just some ideas 
 
 3. Appearance- needs some rearranging.( but i think you already know that",,,,,,,,,,,
